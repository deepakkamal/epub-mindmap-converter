Chapter 10: The Big Cycle Rise and Decline of the British Empire and the Pound

**

## CHAPTER 10 THE BIG CYCLE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE AND THE POUND
Changes in the world order come about when two or more countries (or alliances of countries) of comparable power fight and one wins and becomes dominant enough to set the new rules, which is the new world order. Before this happens, the rising country needs to get itself into a comparable position of strength relative to the reigning country, so the story of any great country’s rise begins long before it becomes a great power.** Likewise, the story of its decline extends long after it ceases to be a great power. That is reflected in the arc chart that shows the simplified version of the cycles of the Dutch, British, American, and Chinese empires that I shared with you before and share here again.

*
The rise of the British Empire started long before it became preeminent, as it first had to build its educational, institutional, and technological strengths to become more competitive and then challenge and defeat the Dutch. This chart shows my gauges of the eight measures of power for the British Empire from 1600 to the present. As shown, competitiveness, education, and innovation and technology levels rose sharply in the early 1600s and continued to increase steadily from 1600 to 1800, which paid off from 1700 to 1900 as the UK’s output, share of world trade, and military expanded together. With the typical lag, the development of Britain’s financial markets and its financial center (London) to become world leaders followed, and, with a greater lag, the pound overtook the guilder as the global reserve currency.

**While the fall of the Dutch in the late 1700s removed the UK’s primary trade and financial competitor, Britain's rise wasn’t complete until the early 1800s because it had one last great rival power to** **defeat—France, led by Napoleon.** You see, Napoleon was on a tear to conquer Europe and be the greatest power via the Napoleonic Wars. This created the usual sort of great power rivalry and balance of power struggle dynamic that I described in the addendum to Chapter 2, with all the alliances and escalation building to a great crescendo. Later in this chapter, I will briefly drop into the French story, also an iconic one, as part of explaining the rise of the British Empire. But for now I will simply jump to the punchline, which is that **Britain won through effective economic as well as military warfare. Then, following the classic Big Cycle script of what happens after wars that establish the dominant power, there was a new world order set out by the winners followed by a long period—in this case 100 years—of relative peace and prosperity. That is when the British Empire became the greatest empire ever.** At its peak, with only 2.5 percent of the world’s population in the UK, the British empire produced over 20 percent of the world’s income and controlled over 20 percent of the world’s land mass and over 25 percent of the global population.

But I’m getting ahead of myself. As shown in the previous chart, the story of Britain’s rise began around 1600, so we should start there. The following chart shows the arc and the timing of key events. The numbers mark the approximate times of the six stages of the internal order cycle.

### THE RISE
To set the stage for the UK’s rise, we need to describe its situation, as well as the broader backdrop of Europe, at the end of the 1600s. For both, the early 17th century had massive conflicts that radically changed or overturned all the prior orders. As explained in the last chapter, **in Europe there was great devastation and change that resulted from the Thirty Years’ War because it was a war between ideologies, religions, and economic classes that created a new European order through the Peace of Westphalia. This treaty established countries as we know them and created a fractured Europe, which led to different choices in different countries**. Great Britain had its own turmoil over wealth and power that took the forms of the English Civil War, which was a brutally violent continuation of the centuries-long battles between classes, and the Glorious Revolution, which less violently led to William III, a Dutch ruler, becoming the king of England. What these conflicts have in common is that they weakened the monarchy and strengthened Parliament. They also established terms for the relationships between the kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland. **The English Civil War specifically led to the king (Charles I) being tried and executed and the monarchy being replaced by the Commonwealth of England under the rule of the general who led the revolt, Oliver Cromwell.**

**These conflicts established rule of law rather than rule of the monarchy and they created a new balance of power between the king and Parliament** that set the foundation for Great Britain’s later rise. That is because a strong Parliament allowed for a moderately meritocratic selection of national leaders, as the prime minister had to command the confidence of Parliament rather than just be a favorite of the royal court. Statesmen who led Britain during its later rise and peak—such as William Pitt the Elder and his son, Will Pitt the Younger, Robert Peel, William Gladstone, and Benjamin Disraeli—were strong forces for shaping Britain. They all came from families of merchants, not the landed gentry.

This revolutionary strengthening of Parliament was heavily influenced by the new Enlightenment thinking about who should have what powers and how governments should work that had spread throughout Europe starting in the late 1600s. That was shaped by the earlier scientific thought of Englishman Francis Bacon (1561–1626). **At the core of this new, human-centric philosophy was the idea that society should be based on reason and science and that the government’s power comes from the people, not from God.**

**Debate and skepticism were encouraged. Improvements in basic education (which caused literacy rates to rise), the dissemination of ideas via printed materials (the first encyclopedias and dictionaries were printed en masse at this time), and a growing number of transnational elites (who were well-read and cultivated cross-border contacts) created a new and wider “public sphere” of political and social thought. The key thinkers during this time produced ideas and concepts that are still important in the Western world.**

Enlightenment ideas influenced different countries in different ways, ranging from more autocratic monarchs like Catherine the Great in Russia to the more representative form of government adopted by America’s Founding Fathers. **The UK particularly reaped the benefits of the Enlightenment’s strong political institutions and rule of law alongside the Enlightenment’s emphasis on science, which supported major discoveries.**

While these strengths did not bring about immediate prosperity, **over time the British system’s respect for the rule of law, combined with strong education, gave it the foundation to gain competitive advantages in commerce and innovations that followed and led to the rise of the British Empire.**

At the same time, **England became financially strong as it created a powerful and centralized fiscal authority that allowed the state to raise significantly more revenue than its international rivals. By the 18th century, the tax burden in Britain was almost twice that of France. The creation of the Bank of England in 1694 helped standardize and increase the liquidity of UK government** **debt, improving its ability to borrow**. Consistent with these reforms, government bond yields fell drastically, both outright and relative to other countries over the early 1700s.

By the early 1700s, there were many other classic signs of an empire on the rise. In these charts, you can see Britain’s leadership in innovation compared to its main rivals at the time.

#### The Industrial Revolution
**A well-educated population together with a culture of inventiveness and the availability of capital to financially support the developments of new ideas—especially about how machines could more efficiently do what many were laboring to do—created a great wave of competitiveness and prosperity. England’s geological endowments of iron and coal gave it a great boost in producing this economic transformation known as the First Industrial Revolution. As described in Chapter 8, this shift changed Europe from a primarily rural and agrarian society in which most people were poor and power resided with landowning elites to an urban and industrial society in which people as a whole got a lot richer (though benefits disproportionately accrued to the elites) and power resided with central government bureaucrats and capitalists. Geopolitically, these strengths led it to overtake the Dutch as the preeminent** **economic and financial power in Europe around 1750, 30 years before the UK defeated the Dutch in the battle and clearly became the world's leading empire.**

The productivity revolution started with agriculture. Agricultural inventions increased productivity, which reduced the labor intensity of farming. It also made food more plentiful and cheaper, which led to a population boom. Together these forces led to people flocking to cities, which benefited industry from the steadily increasing supply of labor. The Industrial Revolution was driven not only by the creation of brand-new inventions like the steam engine but also by adapting and improving on existing concepts to make production more efficient, such as standardizing inputs and moving production from individual artisans to factories. Ample labor, energy, and connected global markets together helped support the burst of innovation. This list gives a sense of the timing and pace of innovation in the UK:

1712: Steam engine invented.
1719: Silk factory established.
1733: Flying shuttle (basic weaving machine) invented.
1764: Spinning jenny (multi-spindle weaving machine) invented.
1765: Separate condenser (for steam engines) invented.
1769: Water frame (hydraulic power for weaving machines) invented; steam engine upgraded.
1785: Power loom invented; iron refining developed.
1801: Steam-powered locomotive on wheels invented.
1816: Steam-powered locomotive on rail patented.
1825: Railway construction initiated on a line connecting Manchester and Liverpool.

Through these revolutionary changes to agriculture and industry Europe became urban and industrial, with goods made by machines in city factories. The new urban population required new types of goods and services, which required the government to get bigger and spend money on things like housing, sanitation, and education, as well as to set up the infrastructure for the new industrial capitalist system to flourish, such as courts, regulators, and central banks. **Power was in the hands of central government bureaucrats and capitalists who controlled the means of production.**

This was most true in the **United Kingdom, which pioneered many of the most important innovations and which used the new methods of production to pull ahead of other nations and become the world’s leading superpower**. As reflected in output per capita, the UK’s living standards caught up to those in the Netherlands by around 1800 and overtook them in the mid-19th century, when the UK approached the zenith of its share of world output (around 20 percent). In parallel to this economic growth—and helping to reinforce it—the UK became the world’s dominant trading nation, pulling decisively ahead of the Dutch in the late 1700s and maintaining that position through the 19th century. At the same time there was an acceleration in the output of all countries through most of the 1800s. Most countries in the world were then in Stages 3 and 4 of the internal order cycle.

Naturally as it became a world economic power the UK needed to be able to fight militarily to both protect and assert its interests. **The UK's military strength—especially its navy—helped it establish its colonies and take over those of other European powers, as well as secure its control over global trade routes. The profitability** **of the empire more than paid for its military spending because it supported economic activities.** Thanks to the Bank of England’s financial innovations and the guilder’s collapse, **London became the world’s financial center and the pound sterling the world’s reserve currency. In other words, Great Britain followed the classic Big Cycle steps of a rising empire.**

Britain also took the Netherlands’ mantle as the top trader with China. With the Industrial Revolution, Europe no longer demanded nearly as much in the way of manufactured luxury goods from China, but instead sought a commodity—tea. China, for its part, wasn’t interested in European goods and continued to seek payment in precious metals. That sowed the seeds of the great British-Chinese conflict that led to the Opium Wars and China’s Century of Humiliation. Who would have imagined that?

The story of Britain’s rise is obvious in retrospect. It’s easy to look back and describe what happened. It’s another thing to position oneself well for it by anticipating it and seeing it happen at the time. I wonder what I would have thought at the time. I wonder whether in looking at the readings of my indicators and systems and thinking about the situations whether I would have bet well. That is why it is so important to me to have the data and the decision rules to see what I would have actually done and what the results would have been. I can now see what the indicators would have shown at the time and know that they would have painted the picture I just described, and I can see from that that the picture would not have been crystal clear that the British Empire would have gone on to become the dominant world empire. If I were alive in the early 1700s and looking at my indicators, I would have seen the Dutch still at their peak and Bourbon France as a major power on the rise also, and I would have seen bullish conditions for them both at that time.

#### Why Not the French?
In the early 1700s, France was a center of education and learning, a hub of the Enlightenment with famous thinkers like Voltaire and Montesquieu, and a home to a booming publishing industry, so my indicators would have shown the French as being just as strong as the Dutch and British powers. From 1720 to 1780, the number of books on the arts and science published in Paris doubled. As the quantity of information increased, so did people’s literacy; over the course of the 18th century literacy rates in France close to doubled.

France also would have shown up as economically strong in the early stage of a big debt cycle upswing. It was just before an investment boom was about to turn into a bubble which later turned into a bust. At the time, France’s most famous economist was John Law (a Scotsman by birth) who thought the creation of new money would stimulate the economy. In 1716 he created a national bank with the ability to issue paper money backed by land, gold, silver, and state bills. That began the upswing in the cycle. The original capital for this bank, Banque Générale, was provided by shareholders, who also sat on the bank’s board. France had had a stock market since 1673, when Finance Minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert’s Ordinance of Trade was codified into commercial law,1 so it had all the ingredients for a classic capital markets upswing. At the same time, Law also created the Company of the West. The Company of the West, or the Mississippi Company, was a trading company with monopoly rights in French Louisiana (half of the present-day United States). Law allowed French government debt to be used to purchase shares in the Mississippi Company. With a new company that had an exciting story about exploiting the opportunities of the new frontier and a bank and government finances supporting this endeavor, all the right ingredients were in place. As the company expanded, state debt holders jumped at the ability to convert their debt into equity. This created what was perceived to be a great investment. Would you have bought in? Would I have bought in? If we didn’t would we have had regrets? The stock soared, eventually becoming a bubble in the classic ways these things happen. When it burst, both shares and bills rapidly lost their value because of the classic reason of the outstanding claims on real assets being much greater than the real assets that were backing up the claims.

**Naturally people in France fled from the depreciating paper money toward hard currency coinage.** New laws prohibited charging interest rates above 5 percent, which meant that only the most credit-worthy borrowers and most stable investments could receive capital. As a result, it became nearly impossible for new businesses to receive funding. There wasn’t enough real money.

On top of that, and quite typically, expensive wars made financial conditions worse. A partial list of wars that France was in follows:

**War of the League of Augsburg (1688–97)**: France, under the leadership of Louis XIV, expanded into modern-day western Germany, spurring war against England, Spain, Austria, and a number of German states.
**War of the Spanish Succession (1701–14)**: France, allied with Spain, fought an alliance of England, Austria, and the Netherlands to contest the inheritance of the Spanish throne. The war ended with the French heir taking the throne of Spain, but with various concessions made to the other powers (including giving up Spanish territory in Italy and Belgium to Austria, and France giving England and the Netherlands colonial and trade concessions).
**War of the Austrian Succession (1740–48)**: France, in alliance with Spain, Prussia, and other German principalities, fought against Austria and the UK, in support of the German princes’ territorial ambitions against Austria.
**Seven Years’ War (1756–63)**: France, allied with Austria, Sweden, and Russia, fought against Britain and Prussia over German territories and French and British colonies abroad, particularly in North America. (This war is also known as the French and Indian War.)
**American Revolution (1775–83)**: France and Spain allied with the American revolutionary forces against the British government.

While a number of these wars produced territorial and strategic gains for France, they turned out to cost much more than they brought in which eventually severely damaged the French government’s finances. Without a modern financial system, France had more difficulty funding its government through debt than Britain did so it had to rely more on burdensome taxes, which were unpopular. One example of France’s inferior financial position affecting its geopolitical position is the differences in experiences of the British and the French during the American Revolution. The French paid for the war effort entirely by floating loans at interest rates at least double those the British government faced. This caused France’s debt service payments to rise to over £14 million compared to Britain’s £7 million (both had national debts of around £220 million). Because the nobility, clergy, and even certain privileged towns often paid lower taxes, high levels of taxation on the rest of society were imposed. That exacerbated France’s already high income inequality. Many French laborers struggled to meet their basic needs. That caused more class warfare.

**Along with extreme income inequality, there was corruption** **and extravagance at the top.** The court of King Louis XVI was infamous for its frivolous spending—for instance, Marie Antoinette’s Hamlet, an ornamental farm near the gardens of Versailles built at great expense to replicate a rustic village. **Two major wars—the Seven Years’ War and the American Revolution—led to massive deficits.** During the American Revolution the deficits were around 2–3 percent of GDP and about a third of France’s annual tax revenue. Meanwhile, the American Revolution further popularized Enlightenment ideas of liberty and equality, while **bad harvests in 1788 and 1789 led to soaring bread prices and famines**. It was a recipe for revolution.

**Due to France’s inefficient and unrepresentative political decision-making system, the government was unable to raise needed revenues or enact needed changes.** Decisions from the ancien régime could be and often were undermined at virtually every lower level. The nobility and clergy resisted decisions that hurt them and were able to carve out broad privileges for themselves. Local authorities (called parlements*) were needed to enact tax policy, but often resisted doing so. The closest thing France had to a legislative body was the Estates General, where representatives of France’s three estates (the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners) met to approve certain legislation when summoned by the king. Its consent was seen as necessary to levy new national taxes; however, its powers and procedures were unclear, and basic questions—like how representatives were chosen and how many votes each estate got—were unsettled. In 1789, the Third Estate—representing the commoners, who made up 98 percent of the population—formed its own assembly, inviting members of the First and Second Estates to join it. To stop this National Assembly from meeting, the king closed their meeting hall.

Protests, riots, and insurrection arose. **In 1791, a newly elected National Convention declared France a republic**, and in January 1793 Louis XVI (by then officially called “Citizen Louis”) was sentenced to death. As is classic in revolutions, violence began soon after, in which those who were deemed insufficiently zealous were purged. It is estimated that between 20,000 and 30,000 people were executed during the French Reign of Terror. By 1795, France was broke, and the assignat—the currency it printed to finance government spending—was experiencing hyperinflation.

As is also classic, the revolution led to a counterreaction in which the revolution’s leaders were themselves arrested and a new constitution written and approved. The new system (the Directorate) proved to be ineffective and was immediately crippled by financial problems. Still, **the government continued to print money and forced wealthy citizens to loan it funds**. Ultimately, the inflationary spiral was halted by the introduction of the hard currency that was acquired through Napoleon’s successful military conquests in Italy and the decision to declare bankruptcy on two-thirds of the government’s debt. Additional measures such as increased taxes further strengthened the government’s fiscal condition. In 1796, the government held a ceremony in which it destroyed the presses it had been using to print money.

#### Enter Napoleon
The bubble, the big wealth gaps, and the costly expense of war led to the bust and then to revolution, which threw out the old order and put in a new one. That new order consisted of revolutionary leaders who fought with each other, producing 10 years of painful chaos that required a strong leader to get control of the mess. It was all consistent with the classic, melodramatic script that has played innumerable times in the past. **As if on cue, Napoleon entered the picture. Napoleon was the classic hero rising to the occasion.** He had gained a sterling reputation as a military commander as France attempted to spread its republican system across Europe, and he was very popular. So, in 1799, he led a coup to install himself as first consul and eventually emperor, and held dictatorial powers until 1814. **Armed with centralized power and widespread support, he stabilized the economy and professionalized the government**; France was widely seen as an empire on the rise and a formidable rival to other European powers.

When Austria and Russia declared war on France, Napoleon scored sizable early military victories. Before long, he controlled Spain, Portugal, Italy, and much of Germany. I won’t go through the history of the Napoleonic Wars, except to say that like other such leaders he overreached. Napoleon’s invasion of Russia swung the tide of war against him. **In the end, France was defeated. Great Britain** **and Russia were the primary victors.**

It should be noted that a significant factor in the war was the UK’s much greater financial strength. Because of their financial strength, **the UK was able to lend a lot of money to the European coalition forces against France.** It was both its financial resources and its naval power that allowed Britain to stay in the fight even as it and its allies suffered repeated defeats.

#### A New World Order: The Congress of Vienna
By now you know how these things go. After a war the victors come together and create a new world order. That happened at the Congress of Vienna. Just as the victors of the Thirty Years’ War had done at Westphalia, **the quadruple alliance of Great Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia reorganized the world order in their favor at the Congress of Vienna (1814–15), creating a system of checks and balances among the European powers that would more or less hold for the next century.** The geopolitical importance of these developments is well-described by Henry Kissinger:

**
It may not have fulfilled all the hopes of an idealistic generation, but it gave this generation something perhaps more precious: a period of stability which permitted their hopes to be realized without a major war or a permanent revolution… The period of stability which ensued was the best proof that a “legitimate” order had been constructed, an order accepted by all the major powers, so that henceforth they sought adjustment within its framework rather than in its overthrow.

All the major powers were represented in Vienna, though the most important decisions were negotiated by the core group and France itself. Like the US at the Paris Peace Conference after World War I and in the negotiations after World War II, the UK didn’t seek to gain significant new territories. Its primary goal was to address the power** **imbalances in Europe that had led to wars. Areas that had previously consisted of weak and divided states, such as Italy, Germany, and the Low Countries, saw significant territorial consolidation to counterbalance more centralized states like France**, while agreements on the navigation of international rivers supported the expansion of trade. Tactically, the Treaties of Paris aimed to contain but not destroy France, which suffered only a minimal loss of territory.2

**The victorious powers were all monarchies, and many of the policies they enacted were aimed at restoring the old status quo** (for example, returning the Bourbon dynasty to power in France). Even so, the new ideas of the Enlightenment continued to have influence. **Governments shifted to more representative and rule-of-law-based systems, though to varying degrees (Tsarist Russia remained largely autocratic).** In England the liberalization came about as a result of gradual reforms, while on the continent a series of revolutions (most famously the liberal Revolutions of 1848) spurred the changes. **In time, nationalist movements led to the unification of Germany and Italy, as well as the destabilization of the multiethnic Austrian and Ottoman empires.**

#### British Power Approaches Its Peak
No power benefited more from the new stability than the British Empire. **Not only were Britain’s main economic and military rivals weakened, but the power equilibrium allowed the UK to avoid expensive military conflicts close to home and focus on trade and its colonies, a policy known as “splendid isolation,” which set the stage for its “Imperial Century.”** Of course there were some bad economic periods during those years (e.g., the Panic of 1825 in the UK, and the panics of 1837 and 1873 in the US), and there were military conflicts (e.g., the Crimean War between Russia on one side and the Ottoman Empire and a coalition of Western European powers on the other). But these were not significant enough to change the big picture, which was of a very prosperous period with the British on top. As mentioned, at their peak in the late 19th century around 1870, the British produced 20 percent of the world’s income and controlled 40 percent of global exports, 20 percent of the world’s land mass, and 25 percent of the world’s population. And the pound, of course, became the world’s undisputed reserve currency. The charts on the following pages help paint the picture of Britain’s dominant strength.

Geopolitically, the UK continued to expand abroad throughout the 19th century, eventually encompassing Canada, Australia, India, and large portions of Africa.3 And even where the British Empire didn’t explicitly take control, it was increasingly able to intervene abroad in order to gain trade access on uneven terms (e.g., the Opium Wars against China ending with a treaty ensuring the UK’s ability to export opium to China despite local Chinese laws against it). Maintaining these colonies gave the UK an assured source of commodities, wealth, and income, and preferential trade arrangements. This chart clearly paints the picture.

### THE TOP
The pound’s status as a reserve currency complemented its dominance in colonial expansion, military reach, global trade, and investment flows. **The UK’s share of global exports rose with the Industrial Revolution and the spread of the empire, peaking around 1850 at about 40 percent of global exports.** And the share of trade denominated in sterling was greater than the UK’s trade share alone. From 1850 to 1914, around 60 percent of global trade was denominated in pounds. This set of conditions sowed the seeds of the decline that typify the top phase of the Big Cycle.

Even as the UK’s share of world exports declined, the UK ran a persistent current account surplus throughout this period. After 1870, this was comprised of a persistent trade deficit funded by returns on overseas investments. The income from the current account surpluses funded an increasing share of global cross-border investment as other countries become more attractive to invest in.

In 1818, the English Rothschild bank made its first major government loan, to Prussia. As the pound became increasingly liquid, a wave of other sovereign borrowers followed, and global debt, global trade, and global capital flows all came to be increasingly denominated in sterling.4 Trust in the pound was bolstered by the economic management of the Bank of England, which increasingly operated as a “lender of last resort” to mitigate the effects of banking panics.5

**Even as the British Empire continued to expand its territorial and financial reach over the final decades of the 19th century, the seeds of its fall were evident, driven by the classic factors of 1) declining competitiveness, 2) rising inequality and conflict, and 3) the rise of new rivals, particularly Germany and the US.**

#### Declining Competitiveness
**Stepping back, the broader story of economic growth in the mid-to-late 1800s was the Second Industrial Revolution,** a sustained period of innovation in which science as well as engineering played a major role, as synthetics and new alloys were produced and the use of new energy sources like petroleum and electricity exploded. This was when the telephone and the incandescent light bulb were developed and automobiles soon followed. **Transportation, communications, and infrastructure improved**, and the rise of corporate capitalism enhanced productivity. **The result was a sizable increase in output per worker in the countries able to make the switch efficiently—primarily the US and Germany.** The UK didn’t keep up, even though British inventions were key to many of these new developments. The UK’s failure to reorganize its industries led to marked declines in output per worker relative to the other leading industrial powers. You can see the secular shift in innovation and economic power in these charts.

#### Rising Inequality
The gains from industrialization were distributed very unevenly in the UK, producing extreme levels of inequality. By the late 1800s, the top 1 percent of the population owned over 70 percent of all wealth, more than in peer countries. The UK’s top 10 percent owned an astounding 93 percent of its wealth.7 As shown in the next chart, the peak in the wealth gap coincided with the peak in the British Empire around 1900, which was the beginning of the next wave of conflict over wealth and power due to large wealth gaps and the classic late Big Cycle conditions described in Part I.

The combination of social change and rising inequality sparked significant tensions. England’s policy response in the mid-1800s focused largely on reform bills that expanded voting rights and reduced the corrupt practices that had made elections less democratic. By the early 1900s, those political reforms were followed by social reforms, which included the introduction of a public pension system, medical and unemployment insurance, and the provision of free lunches for school children. Organized labor was also on the rise, strengthening workers’ bargaining power. By 1911, around 25 percent of eligible men were union members, and the Labour Party became a significant force in politics. This greater power took the form of increasingly large strikes—for example, the first national strike by coal miners in 1912, which led to a minimum wage for miners.

#### Geopolitical Rivals Emerge
**In addition to its domestic issues, the UK faced challengers to its empire abroad**, competing for influence with France in Africa, Russia in the Middle East and Central Asia, and the US in the Americas. **Its most significant rivalry, however, was with Germany.** The United States, the other great rising power, remained blissfully isolationist with a big ocean allowing it to largely ignore the conflicts in Europe.

**When the new world order began at the Congress of Vienna, Germany was still divided into a number of smaller states.** While the Austrian Empire, ruled by the Habsburgs, had a lot of influence, Prussia was swiftly rising and had one of the strongest armies in Europe. **Over the next century, it successfully unified the other German states, becoming a first-rate power. It achieved this thanks in large part to Otto von Bismarck’s brilliant strategic and diplomatic leadership**8 **and the other classic ingredients for success: strong education and competitiveness.**

**Once unified, Germany experienced the classic virtuous cycle of a power on the rise. Viewing an effective education system as a crucial step in its quest to raise its economy to the level of Great Britain’s, the new Germany—and its predecessor states—built one from the ground up**, focusing on teaching both practical trade skills and high-level scientific knowledge, theoretical and applied. Starting in the 1860s, primary education was mandatory for all and enforced by law. Germany also established three new research universities.

**In order to create a culture of innovation, the German government provided credit to corporations, along with technical advice** **and assistance; awarded grants to inventors and immigrant entrepreneurs; bestowed gifts of machinery; and allowed rebates and exemptions of duties on imports of industrial equipment**. **Germany also maintained a strong rule of law, which was explicitly aimed at economic development.**

As a result of these efforts, Germany’s share of the world’s manufacturing output increased from about 5 to 13 percent between 1860 and 1900 while the other European powers’ shares stagnated or decreased. **By 1900, Germany’s GDP had surpassed Britain’s (excluding its empire), although the latter was still the leading trading nation in the world.**

While Bismarck was a skilled diplomat who prioritized economic development and diplomacy with international competitors, his successors were less skilled and more aggressive. **When Wilhelm II became emperor in 1888, he forced Bismarck to resign and adopted a policy of turning Germany into a world power.** This led other powers, primarily Russia and the UK, to increasingly align with France (a bitter rival of Germany since the Franco-Prussian War in 1871) in an effort to contain Germany. **Wilhelm moved to build up Germany’s military, particularly its navy, setting off an arms race with the UK.** This began the next rivalry between great powers.

The UK retained its naval advantage, but the arms race strained the finances of the major powers and further destabilized the geopolitical order. **The rivalry between the UK and Germany was just one of many building across Europe—France and Germany were at odds, Germany was increasingly concerned about Russian industrialization, and Austria and Russia were struggling for influence in the Balkans. Though these countries were intertwined through marriage and commerce more than ever before, and despite most people believing it wouldn’t happen, in 1914 the powder keg exploded into all-out war. This was the first world war because this was the first time the world had become so small and so interconnected that most** **of the major parts of the world were involved in one way or another.**

Given the complexity and scale of World War I, and how extensively it has been written about, I will just attempt to convey the big picture: it was terrible. **The war killed about 8.5 million soldiers and 13 million civilians, leaving all of Europe exhausted, weakened, and indebted.** Russia devolved into revolution in 1917; in 1918, the Spanish flu arrived, killing an estimated 20–50 million people around the world over the next two years. As a percentage of the European population, more people died during this period than in either the Napoleonic Wars or Thirty Years’ War. But the war ended and the next new world order was created.

**In 1919, the victors—the US, Britain, France, Japan, and Italy—met at the Paris Peace Conference to lay out the new world order in the Treaty of Versailles.** The United States, now recognized as a leading power, played a big role in the negotiations. In fact, the term “new world order” was coined to describe US President Woodrow Wilson’s vision for a global governance system (the League of Nations, though this quickly failed). If the Congress of Vienna in 1815 had created a relatively sustainable order, the terms of the Paris Peace Conference did the opposite— it made a second war inevitable though it wasn’t apparent at the time. The territories of the losing powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria) were carved up, and they were forced to pay reparations to the victors. **Those debt burdens contributed to an inflationary depression in Germany from 1920 to 1923. Elsewhere, much of the world entered a decade of peace and prosperity, the Roaring ’20s. As is typical, the debts and the wealth gaps that were built up burst in 1929, causing the Great Depression. These two big boom and bust cycles came unusually close together, though they followed the classic stages. I won’t digress into the 1920s boom to bust sequence here as it was covered elsewhere in this book. But I will pick up the story in the Great Depression.**

**The Great Depression coupled with the large wealth gaps led to a rise in populism and extremism in nearly every major country. In some countries—e.g., the US and the UK—this led to big redistributions of wealth and political power while capitalism and democracy were maintained. In others, particularly those with weaker economies (Germany, Japan, Italy, Spain), populist dictators seized control and sought to expand their empires.**

**Classically, before all-out wars begin, there is typically about a decade of economic, technological, geopolitical, and capital skirmishing.** The time between the depression and World War II was consistent with this rule. As Germany and Japan became more expansionist, they increasingly competed with the UK, the US, and France for resources and influence over territories. Ultimately, those tensions boiled over into war.

**World War II, just two decades after World War I, was even more costly in lives and money. Germany and Japan lost and the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union won, though economically the UK and the Soviet Union lost too and the US gained enormously in relative wealth.** GDP per capita in Germany and Japan fell by at least half, and their currencies collapsed in the aftermath of the war, as these charts show. **As is typical, the winners of the war got together and determined a new world order in 1945.**

### THE DECLINE
**The Allied victory in 1945 produced a tremendous shift of wealth and power, with the US emerging as the world’s dominant empire just as the British had after the Napoleonic Wars.** The British were left with large debts, a huge empire that was more expensive to maintain than it was profitable, numerous rivals that were more competitive, and a population that had big wealth gaps that led to big political gaps.

**It took another 20 years for the British pound to fully lose its status as an international reserve currency.** Just as the English language is so deeply woven into the fabric of international business and diplomatic communications that it would be difficult to replace, the same is true of reserve currencies. Other countries’ central banks continued to hold sizable shares of their reserves in pounds through the 1950s, and a third of all international trade was still denominated in sterling in 1960. **But the pound had been losing status since the end of the war** because smart investors recognized the great contrast between the UK’s and the US’s financial conditions, the UK’s increased debt load, and the UK’s low net reserves, which would make holding pound sterling debt a bad deal.

**The decline in the British pound was a protracted affair that involved several significant devaluations.** After attempts to make the pound convertible failed in 1946–47, it was devalued by 30 percent against the dollar in 1949. Though this worked in the short term, over the next two decades Britain’s declining competitiveness led to repeated balance of payments strains that culminated with the devaluation of 1967. Around this time the deutschemark took the pound’s place as the world’s second most widely held reserve currency. The following charts paint the picture.

#### The Pound’s Suspended Convertibility in 1947 and Its Devaluation in 1949
The 1940s are frequently referred to as “crisis years” for the pound. The war required the UK to borrow immensely from its allies and colonies, and those obligations were required to be held in sterling. When the war ended, the UK could not meet its debt obligations without either raising taxes or cutting government spending, so it necessarily mandated that its debt assets (i.e., its bonds) could not be proactively sold by its former colonies. The US was anxious for the UK to restore convertibility as soon as possible, as the restrictions were reducing liquidity in the global economy, affecting the US’s export profits. The Bank of England was also eager to remove capital controls in order to restore the pound’s role as a global trading currency, increase financial sector revenues in London, and encourage international investors to continue saving in sterling. **In 1946, an agreement was reached in which the US would provide the UK with a loan of $3.75 billion (about 10 percent of UK GDP)** to offer a buffer against a potential run on the pound. As expected, the pound came under considerable selling pressure when partial convertibility was introduced in July 1947, and the UK and the Sterling Area countries turned to austerity to maintain the pound’s peg to the dollar. Restrictions were imposed on the import of luxury goods, defense expenditures were slashed, dollar and gold reserves were drawn down, and agreements were made among sterling economies to not diversify their reserve holdings to the dollar. Prime Minister Clement Attlee gave a dramatic speech calling for the spirit of wartime sacrifice:

**
We are engaged in another battle for Britain. This battle cannot be won by the few. It demands a united effort by the whole nation. I am confident that this united effort will be forthcoming and that we shall again conquer.

Immediately following the speech, the run on the pound accelerated. By the end of August, convertibility was suspended, much** **to the anger of the US and other international investors who had bought sterling assets in the lead-up to convertibility.** The governor of the National Bank of Belgium threatened to stop transacting in sterling, requiring a diplomatic intervention. **The devaluation came two years later, as policy makers in both the UK and the US realized that the pound couldn’t return to convertibility at the current rate.** Competitiveness returned, the current account improved, and by the mid-to-late 1950s full convertibility was restored. The following charts paint the picture.

The devaluation did not lead to a panic out of sterling, even though the fundamentals remained poor, because a very large share of UK assets was held by the US government, which was willing to take the valuation hit in order to restore convertibility, and by Sterling Area economies, such as India and Australia, whose currencies were pegged to the pound for political reasons. Still, **the immediate post-war experience made it clear to knowledgeable observers that the pound would not enjoy the same international role it had prior to World War II**.

#### The Failed International Efforts to Support the Pound in the 1950s and 1960s and the Devaluation of 1967
Though the 1949 devaluation helped in the short term, the pound faced recurring balance of payments strains. These were very concerning to international policy makers, who feared that a collapse in the value of sterling or a rapid shift to the dollar could prove highly detrimental to the new Bretton Woods monetary system (particularly given the backdrop of the Cold War and concerns around communism). **As a result, numerous efforts were made to shore up the pound and preserve its role as a source of international liquidity.** In addition, the UK mandated that all trade within the Common Market would be denominated in pounds and all its currencies pegged to sterling. The result was that for the 1950s and early 1960s, the UK was best understood as a regional economic power and sterling as a regional reserve currency. Yet those measures still didn’t fix the problem: the UK was too indebted and too uncompetitive; it couldn’t pay its debts and still buy what it needed to import. Sterling had to be devalued again in 1967. **After that, even Sterling Area countries were unwilling to hold their reserves in pounds unless the UK guaranteed their underlying value in dollars.**

After the devaluation, little faith remained in the pound. Central banks began to sell their sterling reserves and buy dollars, deutschemarks, and yen, as opposed to simply accumulating fewer pounds in new reserve holdings. The average share of sterling in central bank reserve holdings collapsed within two years. **Countries that continued to hold a high share of their reserves in pounds after 1968 were holding de facto dollars because the Sterling Agreement of 1968 guaranteed 90 percent of their dollar value.**

#### Europe after World War II
As we’ve seen again and again, the terrible costs of war push countries to create new world orders in their aftermaths in an attempt to ensure that such wars can never happen again. Naturally, new world orders revolve around the victor, which is often the newly ascendant empire. After World War II, that was clearly the US.

**The most important geopolitical elements of the post-war order were:**

**The US was the dominant power, which made it the de facto global police force.** Naturally, tensions almost immediately arose between the US and the world’s second leading power, the Soviet Union. The US and its allies formed a military alliance called NATO and the Soviet states formed the Warsaw Pact, and the two faced off in the Cold War.
**The United Nations was established to resolve global disputes.** As is classic, it was headquartered in the heart of the ascendant empire (in this case, New York), with its main power organ, the Security Council, dominated by the war’s victors, as is also classic.

**The most important financial elements of the new world order consisted of:**

**The Bretton Woods monetary system, which established the dollar as the world’s reserve currency.**
**The IMF and the World Bank, designed to support the new global financial system.**
**New York as the new global financial center.**

**From the European perspective, the key aspect of the new world order was the shift from a balance of power in which the preeminent European powers were on top to a world in which they were exhausted and overshadowed by new superpowers that dwarfed any one European state** (especially as their colonies gained independence). Given these pressures and the clear lesson of the costs of division that the World Wars had taught, the value of European unity was clear. That was the impetus for the new European order that gradually developed into the European Union.

The story of Robert Schuman, a key founder of the EU, helps explain why Europe came together. Schuman’s father was a French citizen who became a German citizen when his home region of Alsace-Lorraine was annexed by the Germans in 1871. Schuman was born a German citizen, but became a French citizen when Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France after World War I. As a politician in World War II, he joined the Vichy government before abandoning it for the French Resistance. He ended the war in hiding, with a 100,000 Reichsmark bounty on his head. A key partner to Schuman was West Germany’s first post-war chancellor, Konrad Adenauer. A centrist mayor, he had been driven from political life by the Nazis and sent to a concentration camp in 1944. Following his election as chancellor as a Christian Democrat in 1949, his policies focused on rebuilding the German economy, reconciling with other European powers, and opposing communism. Schuman and Adenauer’s project, along with the rest of the EU’s founders, was to make war “not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible.”

Their first step was to create the European Coal and Steel Community. It sounds like a narrow economic pact, but its explicit goal was to create a European federation. From the Schuman Declaration:

> The pooling of coal and steel production should immediately provide for the setting up of common foundations for economic development as a first step in the federation of Europe, and will change the destinies of those regions which have long been devoted to the manufacture of munitions of war, of which they have been the most constant victims.

The agreement created supranational bodies—a High Authority, a Common Assembly, and a Court of Justice—that bound individual countries to its decisions and regulations, had the ability to levy taxes, could issue loans, and set up programs for worker welfare. Six nations signed on, and more joined over time. Eventually, it evolved into a customs union (in 1957, via the Treaty of Rome), opened up countries’ borders (in 1985, via the Schengen Agreement), and eventually agreed on the framework for a political and economic union, including a shared European citizenship (in 1992, via the Maastricht Treaty).

As is classic, this new European geopolitical order came with a new financial/economic order. The Maastricht Treaty created the basis for a new common currency (the euro) and common economic rules, including rules around government deficits. The integration of its 27 member states (and their more than 400 million people), many of whom had been at war with one another in the past, is an impressive feat—one that puts the EU on a similar standing to the other great powers.

*Europe Empire Arc treats major Eurozone countries as of comparison.

The European Union’s relative declines and crises in the early 21st century occurred for the classic reasons Big Cycle declines occurred, which are reflected in the eight measures of power and other indicators described in Chapter 2. These are the same reasons that other empires have experienced crises. More specifically, Europe’s debt is large, its economy is fundamentally weak, its internal conflicts are relatively large, its vitality and level of inventiveness are relatively weak, and its military is not strong. The wealth and income inequalities between and within its member countries have fueled the rise of populists, many of whom oppose the European Union, and who succeeded in causing the UK to leave it. In short, from its position of a leading empire not long ago, Europe as a whole (and the UK with it) has slipped to a position of secondary power.

Let’s now turn our attentions to the American and Chinese powers.

1 This law created monopolistic joint-stock companies to trade in both the East and West Indies. Colbert’s ordinance was motivated by the desire to fund the trading companies using private funds, and not through the government.

2 The Treaty of Paris in 1814 saw France restore its borders to what they were in 1792, which meant France actually got back some of the colonial territories that the UK had taken during the wars. The Treaty of Paris in 1815, after Napoleon returned from exile and was defeated a second and final time, was less favorable, requiring France to pay a large indemnity, accept an army of occupation, and cede some additional territory, but still left France with the vast majority of the land it had controlled at the time of the French Revolution.

3 A crucial dimension of the UK’s early expansion was the role played by the British East India Company, which starting in the late 18th century and continuing into the 19th century consolidated its political and economic control of modern-day India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. This vast area remained under the private control of the company until a major rebellion in 1857 led the British state to step in and take over India as a British territory.

4 While there were widespread private holdings of pounds internationally, it’s worth noting that for most of the 1800s there wasn’t much in the way of central bank holdings, particularly relative to the role that the dollar plays in central bank portfolios today. Through World War I, central bank assets outside their own currency were generally held in precious metals.

5 The Panic of 1866 demonstrates this well. To simplify the events, the London money markets were the most liquid markets for trade finance, but after a decade of boom lots of lenders were overextended and a big one (Overend, Gurney & Co.) went bust. It was the 19th century equivalent of Lehman Brothers. However, the crisis resolved within days as the Bank of England’s demonstrated willingness to serve as the “lender of last resort” stemmed the loss of confidence in the system.

8 While Prussia, and later the German Empire, were monarchies ruled by the Hohenzollern family, Bismarck had immensely effective powers, having been appointed by the monarch first as minister president of Prussia, and then as chancellor of Germany from unification in 1871 until 1890. According to historian Eric Hobsbawm, “[Bismarck] remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871.”

The unofficial rate shows that the true value of the deutschemark was collapsing during the period.
