# Chapter 14: The Future

Chapter 14: The Future

**

## CHAPTER 14 THE FUTURE
“He who lives by the crystal ball is destined to eat ground glass” is a market adage I learned when I was about 14. Since I’ve personally experienced it to be true, it has affected how I look at both the future and the past. I have learned to look at the past 1) to determine what’s likely to happen and 2) to protect myself and others I am responsible for against the possibility I am wrong or missing something important.** While you and I and others can argue about the patterns and cause/effect relationships described in this book, **if you are reading this for practical purposes rather than just casual interest, then you, like me, need to do those two things well.**

**The purpose of this chapter is to share my thoughts about how I approach the future. While what I don’t know about the future is probably much more than what I do know, what I do know is also a lot. Dealing with the future is all about 1) perceiving and adapting to what is happening, even if it can’t be anticipated; 2) coming up with probabilities for what might happen; and 3) knowing enough about what might happen to protect oneself against the unacceptable, even if one can’t do that perfectly.**

Knowing how things have changed in the past leads me to consider the possibility that something similar might happen in the future. That is a big advantage relative to being unaware. For example, there are numerous examples in history of revolutions, wars, and acts of nature leading to violent events in which virtually all wealth is wiped out or confiscated. Knowing this, I am constantly looking for leading indicators of the same things happening again, and having leading indicators of these things, even if they aren’t perfect, puts me in a better position to protect myself than remaining blissfully unaware and unprepared for what might happen.

While that example is of a worst-case scenario, being unaware of best-case scenarios can be equally bad. I remember very well how my dad and his friends failed to take advantage of the boom that followed the Great Depression and World War II, as their mindsets had been formed by those awful eras. In playing the game of life it pays to do one’s best to understand how the world works, imagine the full range of possibilities (including their risks and rewards), and know how to spread one’s bets around well.

While I will pass along my thinking, please remember that everything I say is debatable; the purpose of this whole project is to improve my assessed probabilities of being right. As such, it is a work in progress, and I hope you will join me in evolving it. To that end, I plan to continually update my understandings of these patterns and lessons at economicprinciples.org, where we can interact to refine the picture.

### MY APPROACH
To quickly review, **my approach is based on my ideas about a) evolution, which causes changes over time, generally toward improvement, such as increasing productivity, b) cycles, which cause rhythmic ups and downs in the economy (like debt bubbles and busts) and bumps along the way (non-rhythmic ups and downs, like acts of nature), and c) indicators that can help us see where we are in the cycles and what might come next**. I will briefly recap my thoughts on each.

### EVOLUTION
**The most important things evolve in ways that are easy to see and extrapolate forward**, so it’s not difficult to get a pretty good sense of roughly where they are likely to be in the future, so long as a once-in-500-years-type game changer doesn’t come along. The following charts tell the story about population, life expectancy, and prosperity.

Let’s start with world population. The chart on the left starts at 1500 and the one on the right starts at 1900. I show them both because I want you to see how different one’s perspective would be if one were looking back 100 years from 1900 versus 100 years from today. Note how dramatically the population grew in the 20th century. Also note that the major historical events mentioned in this book—including the Great Depression, the two World Wars, and any number of natural catastrophes—had no visible effect on the larger evolutionary trend.

*

The next two charts show the population growth rate. Notice the big ups and downs that don’t show up in the prior charts because they are so minor in comparison to the long-term trend. If we had personally experienced any of this volatility, it would have felt like a life or death experience (which it very much was).

The next two charts show a similar picture for life expectancy. There are a lot more wiggles in these charts than in the previous ones because average life expectancy changes more when there are big events like wars and pandemics (I will show you what those big killers were and where they occurred at economicprinciples.org). Note how life expectancy stayed roughly the same (about 25–30 years) for about 350 years and then accelerated starting around 1900, when there were big improvements in infant mortality rates and several medical advances, like antibiotics.

1
Now let’s look at economic prosperity as measured by real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) GDP. The first chart shows a similarly, sweeping picture: the real value of what was produced per person grew slowly until the 19th century and then accelerated, with that broad evolutionary trend dominant relative to the wobbles within it.

The next chart shows real wealth per capita since 1900. From 1900 until 1945, there was no increase to speak of as that was the late-cycle transition phase from the 19th century boom to the new world order in 1945. Peace and prosperity followed the creation of the new world order, and the uptrend was strong and pretty steady (averaging 4 percent per year), even though the movements around it felt big when we went through them.

**With these evolutions in mind, let’s start looking toward the future.**

If we look back carefully to see how the present was created, we can see that these evolutionary advances didn’t just happen on their own: every day, there were events that affected the present while people’s actions shaped them. At the same time, we know that we never could have anticipated them individually—if we had tried to predict each of the specific wars, droughts, pandemics, inventions, prosperous periods, declines, etc., we would have failed. But even without knowing about any of those specific developments, we could have pretty confidently said that advances would occur that would enable significantly larger populations to live significantly longer while enjoying significantly higher standards of living because of the evolution that has already occurred, and that we have every reason to expect to continue to occur, from humanity’s inventiveness. We could have also confidently asserted that there would be booms and busts, feasts and famines, and periods of great health and disease along the way.

Based just on what happened in the past 100 years, one might conclude that one can get pretty good estimates just by extrapolating the past forward. As an example, by simply extrapolating the past 100 years, it would be reasonable to expect that in the next 10 years the world’s population will be around 10–15 percent higher than it is today, the output per person will be about 20 percent higher, the wealth per person will be 30 percent higher, and the average life expectancy will be 7.5 percent higher, give or take a bit. It would be reasonable to expect that in the next 20 years they will be up 25–30 percent, 45 percent, 70 percent, and around 15 percent, respectively, without knowing specifically how that will happen.

That simple, not-especially-thoughtful analysis paints a picture that probably won’t be far off—but it could be. It is easy to paint this picture in much greater detail by looking at the same stats for each country and each sub-group within a country in this way. Processing all of this information is pretty complicated for the human mind alone, but not for a good human mind working with a computer.

But we can see that a picture drawn from pure extrapolation is not good enough. For example, standing in 1750, it would have been reasonable to believe that it was a timeless and universal truth that monarchies and landowning nobles overseeing peasants with the help of soldiers would be the governance system in the future, that agricultural land would continue to be the most important money-earning asset, that per capita incomes would grow at only around half a percent per year, and that life expectancy would remain steady at about 30 years. That was how it had always been. You would not have imagined capitalism and democracy as we now know it, let alone that there would be a United States and that it would be the leading world power.

The big curveballs come when a few really big things cause a paradigm shift that alters the evolutionary rates of change. The paradigm shifts that came in the early 19th century arose from the confluence of the invention of modern tools of finance, machines that could do the work of people, the development of more inclusive societies that broadened opportunities to be inventive and productive, the increased use of books and libraries so knowledge could be more broadly shared, and the application of the scientific method. While these things couldn’t be anticipated, they could have been perceived, understood, and adapted to. That’s why  while extrapolating the past is generally a reasonable thing to do, also be prepared to be surprised because the future will be much different than you expect it to be.*

Throughout my roughly 50 years of investing, I have seen a number of well-established beliefs based on both what happened before and what seemed logical at the time be proven wrong (to choose a recent example, the belief that bond yields can’t go negative). The greatest recent disruptor of well-established beliefs was the Digital Revolution. Through these experiences and observations I learned that * identifying**, understanding, and adapting to paradigm shifts is essential, even if one can’t anticipate them—though trying to anticipate them with good indicators that help is important too.* Having good indicators can also help you tell when what looks like a paradigm shift is only a passing fad, which is just as important.

### CYCLES AND BUMPS ALONG THE WAY
**Cycles and bumps were covered comprehensively in prior chapters, but they warrant reflection now that we are shifting our attention from the past to the future.**

**Though they barely register when compared to the mega-macro picture, they can damage and kill large numbers of people. Just look at the following charts that show depressions, declines in wealth, deaths in wars, and deaths via pandemics over the past 500 years to gain some perspective about them.** Those bad times were even worse than they look because the charts capture them in terms of averages; as such they understate the severity of the experience for the people who were most directly affected. Most people don’t think about this darker picture. They look at the positive post-1945 trends and extrapolate them forward. It’s up to you to decide if you’re in that camp too. As for me, seeing that these big, deadly things have happened in the past leads me to distrust the belief that they won’t happen again. Unless and until someone shows me better evidence that they won’t happen again than the simple fact that they haven’t happened yet, I am going to assume they will and try to protect myself from their consequences.

*

One of the overarching principles I derived from my research and my 50-plus years of investing experience is  in the markets and in life, to be successful one should bet on the upside that comes from a) evolution that leads to productivity improvements, but not so aggressively that b) cycles and bumps along the way knock you out of the game.* In other words, betting on things being better—e.g., real earnings being greater—is pretty much a sure bet. But betting too much on that so that a bump along the way can ruin you is bad. That’s why having quality indicators helps a lot.

### QUALITY INDICATORS
**Because everything that happens is the result of events that have happened before, I have some pretty good and logical, though imperfect, leading and coincident indicators of important changes.** **Some can be quantified, while others can’t be.**

**As previously explained, I found 18 determinants that explain most of the conditions and changes in wealth and power both within and between nations. I will soon show you the readout of all of these 18 determinants for each of the 11 major powers I’m following in this book (more detail on the top 20 countries is shown at economicprinciples.org). But first I want to share some big-picture thoughts about the five determinants that have had the biggest impacts in the past and that I believe will have the biggest impacts on what happens in the years ahead: innovation, the debt/money/capital market cycle, the internal order and disorder cycle, the external order and disorder cycle, and acts of nature.** When looking at the charts, remember that in some cases the determinants rise and fall together because they are mutually reinforcing, while in others one country’s gains are at the expense of another’s. For example, inventing new technologies raises all of humanity’s living standards, but it puts the countries that are better at inventing in a superior position. Rising levels of military strength are clearly less beneficial for humanity, as they benefit some countries at the expense of others.

### HUMANITY’S INVENTIVENESS
**As previously discussed, innovation and inventiveness are clearly the most powerful determinant of a country’s conditions.**

Think about all the things that we can’t imagine not having that were invented or discovered in just the last 150 years. Before we had them, nobody could have imagined them—e.g., the telephone (1876), the electric light bulb (1879), the internal combustion powered vehicle (1885), the radio (1895), movies (1895), the airplane (1903), television (1926), antibiotics (1928), the computer (1939), nuclear weapons (1945), nuclear power plants (1951), GPS (1973), digital cameras (1975), online shopping (1979), the internet (1983), online search (1990), online banking (1995), social media (1997), Wi-Fi (1998), the iPhone (2007), CRISPR gene editing (2012), etc., etc., etc. Progress unfolds in big and steady ways to shape the future but does so through specific breakthroughs that we can’t imagine. That is what evolution in technologies and techniques looks like. Evolution in most everything else—approaches to life, domestic and international politics, etc.—happens in a similar way.

**I believe that humanity’s evolution through its inventiveness is accelerating and that most people will benefit from it.** That is because the most significant inventions we are now seeing, and that we know we will see many more of, improve the quality and quantity of all thinking. These inventions are coming in the forms of advances in computers, AI, and other thinking-related technologies. Because they can be applied to many domains of human activity and decision making, it seems obvious to me that the rate of invention and improvement in most areas will accelerate at an even faster pace, rapidly raising productivity and living standards.

Humans now have computers to help them think in ways in which they are comparatively handicapped (e.g., computers have far more memory than the human brain and it is readily accessible, they can process more data at a fantastically faster rate, and they do not make emotional mistakes); at the same time, humans can help computers get past their inherent limitations (e.g., their complete absence of imagination, intuition, common sense, value judgements, and emotional intelligence). This collaboration between humans and computers will increase both the quantity and quality of thinking,2 portending radical improvements in almost every area of life. I know this because I have experienced it, and I can already see some of these improvements on the horizon.

In other words, **the abilities of both computers and humans will improve at an increasing pace. Perhaps most importantly, advances in and the wider use of quantum computing with AI will lead to** **unimaginable advances in rates of learning and improvement and changes in global wealth and power. These changes will occur in varying degrees in the next five to 20 years, but I believe they will add up to the greatest shift in wealth and power that the world has ever seen. Quantum computing with AI will be to traditional computing what the computer was to the abacus, providing humanity with vastly more power to see, understand, and shape things. That makes me long-term very optimistic and eager to bet on great new discoveries.**

Even without the boosts from quantum computing, I’d expect the human lifespan to increase by a lot over the next two decades (by 20–25 percent or more), for reasons we can see and for many more reasons that we can’t yet see. A few inventions that are already on the horizon are AI and robotics in healthcare, health monitoring, and advice-providing wearables; advances in and the practical use of genome sequencing and gene editing; mRNA improvements in vaccines; and breakthroughs in nutrition and drugs. And if the past is any guide (and it is) there will be many more inventions that we can’t yet fathom.

Naturally I can’t help but imagine the implications for investing. All else being equal, equities in the companies making new inventions and the companies that benefit from them are the right ones to own if you want to bet on evolution happening, but whether the returns to investors match the performance of the innovations depends on how governments decide to divide the profits of productivity. If the world is financially overextended and has large wealth gaps, this creates headwinds. Also, price matters. It’s possible to invest in great companies and lose money because they are so expensive and invest in bad companies and make money because they are so cheap. Finally, and as with everything else, there are downsides. Humanity’s inventiveness and the new technologies it produces can have bad as well as good effects. Advances in technologies for inflicting harm will certainly occur alongside advances in medical care. So my view is that **inventiveness and increases in living standards will probably get a** **lot better a lot faster—if humanity doesn’t kill itself first**.

The next chart shows our latest reading on the inventiveness, technological advancement, and entrepreneurship we see in major countries. The arrows on the top of the bars show whether the trend in each country’s standing has been up, sideways, or down. This gauge gives about half its weight to 1) a combination of external rankings and measures of innovation per capita (to help capture how widespread innovation is in the economy) and half to 2) the country’s absolute share of key innovation metrics (e.g., researchers, R&D spending, patents, Nobel Prizes, and venture capital funding). Like all my gauges, it is approximately right but not perfectly right, so it’s meant to be broadly indicative. **As shown, the US is at the top of these measures with a marginal lead over China, which ranks second (primarily due to the US’s share of global research spending, researchers, and its lead in other areas such as venture capital funding). But the US’s position is steady, while China’s position in the standings is rising fast. Remember that whoever wins the technology war usually wins the economic and military wars.** For more detail on all the gauges shown in this chapter, please refer to the end of this chapter, where you can read a short description of each.

### THE DEBT/MONEY/CAPITAL MARKET/ECONOMIC CYCLE
As I explained earlier, this cycle is the biggest driver of the ups and downs in economies that have big implications for internal and external politics and wars, so knowing where countries are in this cycle is essential to anticipating what’s likely to come next.

**Based on my readings of history, my readings of existing conditions, and my understanding of how the economic machine works, the promises that are denominated in the world’s reserve currencies, most importantly the dollar, are too large and growing too fast to be paid in hard money. In other words, the debt that is denominated in these currencies is an overhang, so money will probably be printed to service debts and debt growth**4 **and interest rates will probably be held below inflation and economic/income growth rates. This reflects the fact that the major reserve currency countries are late in their debt/money/capital market/economic cycles and that wealth will probably be increasingly redistributed from those who have a lot of it to those who don’t have enough of it in one way or another. The extent to which these things will be true will vary from country to country, though it will likely be worldwide.**

For that reason, **the biggest risk in the long run is the “currency value of money” risk, which most people don’t pay enough attention to. I hope Chapter 4 helps people understand and deal with it better**.

To be clear, because the reserve currency countries that are running big deficits have their deficits and debts denominated in their own currencies, their ability to print the money to service the debts transfers the risks from them as debtors to those who are holding the debt as creditors. **So, the big risk is not that those big debtors will default; it is that creditors will hold assets that will be devalued—i.e., that the returns from holding debt assets will be less than the inflation rate.** I believe a great transfer of wealth from creditors to debtors (as happened in the biblical years of Jubilee, as explained in Chapter 3) is coming for the same reasons it has always come in the past.

**What does that mean for the dollar (most importantly) and the other more minor reserve currencies?** Will they decline and others replace them? **Most probably they will decline analogously to past reserve currency declines: slowly for a long time and then very quickly.** As we saw in those cases, the pace of reserve currency decline significantly lags the pace of the declines in other measures of strength. Reserve currencies tend to live on long after their fundamentals cease to justify their prominence because they become deeply entrenched in the ways things are done and there is a strong inclination to keep them. Then they abruptly plunge when it becomes clear that the fundamentals behind the currency make holding debt in it a bad deal.

The fall happens fast because the currency’s rate of decline outpaces the interest rate paid to the holders of the debt; the net losses lead to selling, which causes more losses, so the spiral becomes self-reinforcing. The Dutch guilder and the British pound both plunged in this way due to geopolitical crises/defeats happening when they had large debts. Those events made it clear to creditors that their fundamentals were weaker than they had assumed and the interest rate couldn’t compensate for the decline.

While I have very good indicators to identify this kind of decline happening as it happens, and some pretty good leading indicators that indicate when it will happen in the short term, my long-term leading indicators are only so-so for timing purposes. That is because they are financial and based on supply and demand. It is pretty easy to assess the financial conditions of countries in the same ways that one assesses the financial conditions of people and companies (by checking whether they are running surpluses or deficits and have more assets than liabilities, and finding out if their debts are in their own or foreign currencies and who is funding them and why). Because these are all long-term drivers, it is also pretty easy to see which countries and currencies are vulnerable. But anticipating exactly when the big fall will happen is difficult.

**The debt burden gauge shown next is based on a combination of a) debt levels relative to asset levels, b) the sizes of external and internal surpluses and deficits, c) the sizes of debt service costs relative to GDP, d) the amount of debt in a country’s own currency versus foreign currency, e) the amount of debt held by its own citizens versus foreigners, and f) its credit rating.** I composed it this way because this way has proven to be the most reliable way we have of foreshadowing declines in the real value of money and the debt assets that are promises to receive money, whether they come in the form of debt defaults that result from not creating enough money and credit to satisfy excessive debt needs or devaluations that come from creating more than enough money and credit to satisfy excessive debt needs. I constructed this index to exclude reserve currency status so that I can see the exposure a country would have if it lost its reserve currency status. Reserve currency status is shown in the chart that follows.

Together these charts paint a pretty clear picture. For example, while the **US’s debt burdens are high, its debt is denominated in dollars, the world’s leading reserve currency, so it has the ability to print money to service its debts. This reduces its risk of default but increases its devaluation risk. As you can see, if the US lost its reserve currency status, it would be in serious financial trouble.** Russia and Germany rank strongest on the debt burden gauge because they are the least indebted. Russia has no reserve currency status, and Germany has a fair amount because it uses the euro, now the second most important reserve currency. China is in the middle of the rankings on the debt burden gauge because its debts are moderately high, mostly in its own currency, and mostly held by the Chinese. Its reserve currency status is emerging.

### THE INTERNAL ORDER AND DISORDER CYCLE
Luo Guanzhong’s classic book Romance of the Three Kingdoms* begins: ***“The empire long divided must unite and long united must divide. Thus it has ever been.”*** That has been true of China and most other places, and it is likely to continue, so it’s a good principle. I explained the big cycle of internal order and disorder in Chapter 5, so I won’t reiterate it here other than to remind you of a key principle: * peace is profitable and war is costly.*

That holds both within countries and between them. When parties cooperate and compete well, and don’t waste resources on fighting, productivity and living standards rise. When they fight, they waste resources (sometimes including lives), they destroy more than they produce, and living standards fall. It is for this reason that the degree of conflict within a country is such an important indicator.

**As of this writing there are varying amounts of conflict going on within different countries, as shown in the next chart. Internal conflict is especially high in the United States, which appears to be in Stage 5 of the cycle (when there are bad financial conditions and intense conflict), while China appears to be in Stage 3 (when there is peace and prosperity). Changes to this measure can happen quickly**—e.g., the changes that produced the Arab Spring, the conflicts in Hong Kong, internal wars in Syria and Afghanistan, recent big protests in Peru and Chile, etc.—leading to revolutionary changes in their internal orders. **Because I expect that these readings will be out of date by the time this book is in your hands, I will update them regularly at economicprinciples.org.**

*
At the end of the day,  power rules and tests of power are the ways one learns who rules.* Sometimes that happens within a framework of rules that are respected. In those cases, fights for power occur in a mutually agreed-upon and productive way that supports the internal order. But they can also happen in unproductive, no-holds-barred ways that can lead to the violent disruption of both the leadership and the internal order. **While I think that the odds of the US devolving into a Stage 6 (civil-war-type) dynamic within the next 10 years are only around 30 percent, that is a dangerously high risk that must be protected against and watched closely via my coincident and leading indicators.**

All internal orders, even those that are not democratic, have rules about how decisions are made and how power is gained and shared. Because one can usually see how well these governance rules are respected or ignored, it is pretty easy to see when an internal order is being threatened by an emerging civil war. For example, when close elections are adjudicated and the losers respect the decisions, it is clear that the order is respected. When power is fought over and grabbed, that clearly signals the significant risk of a revolutionary change with all its attendant disorder.

There have been signs of that happening in the US, with some people contesting the validity of elections and expressing a willingness to fight for their aims. This bears watching.

**There is also an exceptional amount of polarization in the US right now, as reflected in the stats**. Survey data about the sentiments of the voters paints a picture of polarization and intransigence. For example, in a 2019 Pew survey 55 percent of Republicans and 47 percent of Democrats viewed the other as more immoral than other Americans, and 61 percent of Republicans and 54 percent of Democrats said that those of the other party don’t share their values. When asked whether they had warm or cold feelings to those of the other party, 79 percent of Democrats and 83 percent of Republicans said they had “cold” or “very cold” feelings for members of the other party (of that, 57 percent of Democrats and 60 percent of Republicans selected “very cold”). Another study reported that 80 percent of Democrats think that the Republican Party has been taken over by racists and 82 percent of Republicans think that the Democratic Party has been taken over by socialists. A 2010 study showed that nearly half of Republican parents and a third of Democratic parents would be displeased if their child married someone from the other political party. That compares with about 5 percent for both parties in 1960. One recent survey showed that 15 percent of Republicans and 20 percent of Democrats thought the country would be better off if large numbers of the other side “just died.”

Very important and very telling political conflicts and changes lie ahead in the next few years. They will be indicative of what the next stage in the increasingly disorderly internal orders will be like in the major countries, especially in the US. **While the United States looks like it is in the precarious Stage 5 of the cycle, it also has the longest-lasting and most widely admired internal order (its constitutional system).** As explained in Chapter 5, this makes it less likely that it will be abandoned, but more traumatic if it is. The most reliable signs of an escalation to civil war are 1) the rules being disregarded, 2) both sides emotionally attacking each other, and 3) blood being spilled. While Stage 6 is the most dysfunctional and harmful stage, increasing amounts of dysfunction happen in the stages leading up to it. These sorts of conflicts can exist throughout society, not just in government.

Shown next is how the conflict gauge has changed for the US since the late 1700s, including the breakdowns between the two sub-gauges. What these charts reflect is that the **overall level of conflict within the United States is now as high as it’s been since the civil rights and Vietnam War protests of the late 1960s, but meaningfully less than it was then. The “internal strife” index (which mostly reflects demonstrations in the streets) is moderately high, and the “political conflict” index is the highest it’s been since the early 1920s**, when a deep post-war recession and massive labor unrest6 contributed to big electoral losses for the Democrats.

*

Note that the comparable periods before then were the 1900s–1910s (which saw a backlash against the “robber barons,” the rise of the Progressive movement, and eventually World War I), and the 1860s, when economic and values conflicts led to civil war. **The risks are high, but not unprecedentedly so.** Still, the picture should be scary for Americans and scary for the world because the world’s leading power is on the brink and could tip one way or the other. Fractured conditions within the US are now contributing to instability in other parts of the world. Any worsening would be at least as disruptive as those past periods.

So what does this all mean for the US? As I explained in Chapter 11, our measures suggest that it is very roughly 70 percent through its big cycle. Can it slow or reverse its relative decline? **History shows us** **that reversing a decline is very difficult because it requires undoing so many things that have already been done. For example, if one’s spending is greater than one’s earnings and one’s liabilities are greater than one’s assets, those circumstances can only be reversed by working harder or consuming less. The question is whether we Americans can face our challenges honestly and adapt and change to meet them.** For example, while the capitalist profit-making system allocates resources relatively efficiently, Americans now need to ask themselves: “Who is it optimizing these efficiencies for?” “What should be done if the benefits are not broad-based?” “Will we modify capitalism so that it both increases the size of the pie (by increasing productivity) and divides it well?” These questions are especially important to answer in an era when, thanks to new technologies, employing people will increasingly become unprofitable, inefficient, and uncompetitive. “Should we, or should we not, invest in people to make them productive, even when it’s uneconomic to do so?” “What if our international competitors choose robots over people?” These and so many more important, difficult questions come to mind. **But while we can’t know for certain whether the splits and conflicts in the US will increase or reverse, we do know that the long-term momentum is toward increasing division and this is a serious risk. The fact that the US is simultaneously deeply indebted, its international standing is weakening, and it is experiencing serious conflict should be concerning both to Americans and to non-Americans who depend on them.** At the same time, in its 245-year history the US has shown a great capacity to bend without breaking. The greatest challenges it faces are internal ones: **can it remain strong and united, or will it continue to allow division and internal struggles to lead to decline?**

### THE EXTERNAL ORDER AND DISORDER CYCLE
All empires decline and new ones rise to replace them.* Understanding when that change might happen requires watching all of the indicators and tracking the relative conditions of countries. Remember from earlier in the book that there are five major types of wars that have existed throughout history: 1) trade/economic wars, 2) technology wars, 3) capital wars, 4) geopolitical wars, and 5) military wars. The external conflict gauge shown here measures the levels of economic, political/cultural, and military conflict between pairs of major countries. As shown, the greatest conflict is between the US and China, the two greatest powers in the world that have comparable amounts of power—more than enough to make a war between them the most devastating in history.

*
**The amount of this conflict is 1 standard deviation above normal, which is pretty severe in relation to past conflicts between countries.**

**This next chart shows my index of conflict just between the US and China since 1970.**

Based on what we have been seeing, the United States and China are clearly in four types of war (trade/economic war, technology war, capital war, and geopolitical war), though not intensely but they are intensifying. They are not yet in the fifth type of war (military war). As shown in the previous cases, in particular the 1930–1945 case, these four types of wars precede military wars by about five to 10 years. Though the risks of military war seem relatively low, they are increasing.

Looking back over the last 500 years, one can see that military wars between major empires started on average about once every 10 years, give or take a couple of years, and it has been about 75 years since the last really big one (World War II). Since 1500, major powers have been at war a little bit more than half the time.7 From that perspective, the odds of a big military war in the next 10 years are about 50/50, but of course that’s simple minded. Let’s look at the picture a bit more carefully.

**The following chart shows the current individual readings of my military strength gauge. While overall these readings make sense—the US is the most powerful by most measures, China is the next most powerful, Russia comes next, etc.—they don’t capture the important realities beneath these summary numbers. For example, they don’t show that some countries are as powerful as or more powerful than the United States in specific geographic areas (e.g., right around China) and in some types of warfare (e.g., space, cyber, etc.) Also, they don’t consider the effects of military cooperation and alliances (e.g., China and Russia), and they can’t account for what unknown military abilities countries may have. For me, the big headline is that there are lots of ways these countries can hurt or destroy each other in the most contested geographic areas**.

History shows that wars are terribly costly in lives and money, and the capacity to inflict harm has advanced exponentially since nuclear weapons were developed and used in World War II. I am unable to imagine what the next military war would look like. I have also seen that those who are most informed on both sides are not fully informed because a lot is unknown and because military wars always transpire in unexpected ways. For those reasons, **it is impossible to confidently say who the winners and losers in the next big war would be**. We also know from logic and from studying history that the losers of really big wars are completely wiped out and the winners lose too, as they suffer severe consequences and end up with big debts. What that means for economies and markets was explained earlier in the book, but in a word, it is devastating.

Students of history know that the doctrine of mutually assured destruction prevented the US and the USSR from entering a hot war before the Soviet Empire fell, mostly due to the failure to grow its other strengths in the face of big military spending. China is roughly comparable in power to the United States in the most important ways, and it is on its way to becoming more powerful in many ways. China won’t be as easy to defeat in any of the five types of war as the USSR was, and the USSR wasn’t easy to defeat. That means the wars are likely to intensify and increasingly favor China, especially if the US doesn’t turn around the other fundamental underpinnings of strength that are highlighted in this chapter. However, it seems like it will be a long time before China can win a war without having the war lead to its own destruction as well.

So, in summary, my computer and I working together now believe that **because for the foreseeable future China and the US will be powerful enough to inflict unacceptable harm on each other the prospect of mutually assured destruction should prevent military war, though there almost certainly will be dangerous skirmishes. I expect this to be true unless some unexpected technological breakthrough, like dramatic advances in quantum computing, gives one of these powers such an asymmetrical advantage that mutually assured destruction would cease to exist.** Also, though of less importance, an impediment to fighting is the interlinked well-being of Americans and the Chinese in this highly interconnected world.

**However, as time passes the risks increase. If the US continues to decline and China continues to rise, what matters most is whether or not each can do so gracefully. The big risk is that when existential irreconcilable differences exist and there is no mutually agreed-upon party or process to adjudicate the conflict, there is a good chance that there will be a fight.** As explained in the last chapter, **the main seemingly irreconcilable difference between the US and China is over Taiwan, so I am watching developments there very closely**. Taiwan is a one-of-a-kind interest that China would fight for because of its belief that “there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China.” It is doubtful that the US would consider it worth a major fight to defend, though it might. This seems to me to be the only possible trigger for a military war between the two greatest powers in the next 10 years.

The next locations to pay attention to are the areas immediately around China, like those countries surrounding the East and South China Seas, and other neighbors such as India, Russia, South Korea, North Korea, Japan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc. Considering what China’s culture is like and what’s most beneficial for China, I believe it will work to influence those countries through an exchange of benefits but won’t fight to control them outright.

**While the most important conflicts are between the United States and China, there are other important players operating in this classic drama of the balance of power and the prisoner’s dilemma.** It is important to watch the actions of China’s and the United States’ allies and friends. As previously discussed, the alignments are gradually changing, with China gaining allies and the United States losing them. Overextended and less willing to lose lives fighting for others, the US is now in the position of trying to cat herd its allies without catnip. In the past, the US merely needed to hint at what it wanted other countries to do for them to do it. Now they go their own ways.

In the end, which country wins the game of obtaining the most wealth and power depends most on their internal capacities, which is why I monitor those factors in my indices as I do for military strength. As the Chinese know very well (and it would be good for others to keep in mind),  the best way to fight a war is to get strong and show one’s opponent one’s strength so they don’t want to fight violently.* This will most likely be the dynamic that we see in the years ahead.

All of this is to say that **I think the odds favor intensifying trade/economic wars, technology wars, capital wars, and geopolitical wars as China becomes even more competitive and increasingly goes global in these areas.** As Graham Allison explained in his excellent book, *Destined for War*, in the past 500 years, when two nearly equal powers experienced irreconcilable differences, there were military wars in 12 out of 16 cases, and big military buildups were associated with major wars in 80–90 percent of cases.8 I balance those historical insights with the logic of mutually assured destruction, which lowers the odds of war. On net, I would conclude that the probability of a big war in the next 10 years is 35 percent, give or take, which is essentially a wild guess. In any case, it’s a dangerously high risk.

### ACTS OF NATURE
Throughout history, droughts, floods, pandemics, and other severe natural and biological disasters have inflicted more harm on people than people have inflicted on themselves, killing millions, disrupting economies, and contributing to the falls of many empires and dynasties. This chart shows some of the major events.

*
While we all know about climate change, no one knows precisely how much damage and how many deaths it will ultimately cause. But based on expert projections, there is reason to believe that all of these kinds of disasters will be bigger in the years ahead than they were before. While I’m no expert on the subject myself, I can show you some interesting stats and pass along what I’ve learned.

**The next chart on the right shows the world’s average temperature and the amount of CO2, indicating global warming. There is** **little doubt this is happening, will pick up, and will have big and costly effects. What is notable is this is increasing at a faster rate. The chart on the left shows the very long-term perspective on temperature (since 0 CE).**

**This chart captures extreme environmental events. The headline is that from 1970 to 2020 they increased from fewer than 50 per year to nearly 200 per year and are trending higher.**

The next chart shows the estimated dollar cost of these events (adjusted for inflation). As shown, this is also trending higher, with extreme spikes.

**It is pretty clear to me that humanity and natural evolution together are doing great damage to the environment that will be very costly in both money and quality of life.** This will affect countries very differently, in ways that we can broadly anticipate based on their locations, climates, and—most importantly—industries. At the same time, this is a slow, steady, and well-telegraphed change, which lends itself to the kind of adaptation and innovation humanity is uniquely able to do, though often too slowly and only in response to pain. I am inclined to believe that slowly and reactively is how it will happen. Having said that, I don’t know enough about the subject to know what it means for every country and locality.

**The next chart shows an index of climate change vulnerability across major countries based on an equal average of the Notre Dame-Global Adaptation Index (ND-GAIN) Country Index, which quantifies a country’s vulnerability to climate change, and academic estimates of the future impact of climate change on GDP by country.**

### IN SUMMARY
**Based on just these five indicators, it appears to me that:**

**Humanity’s inventiveness will probably lead to great advances while the debt/economic cycle, the internal order cycle, the external order cycle, and worsening acts of nature will almost certainly pose problems. In other words, there will be a battle between humanity’s inventiveness and these other challenges.***
**Very different conditions exist within and between countries, which will determine which countries will rise and decline and in what ways.**

All of this reflects my thinking about the future of the world’s 11 major countries based on just five of the 18 determinants. Now let’s look at all 18 indicators to see what they tell us.

### ALL THE MAJOR DETERMINANTS ACROSS THE WORLD
The following table paints a much richer picture of what’s happening and what is likely to happen across the 11 major countries. While I have many of these readings for the top 20 countries, I don’t have the space to show them here; you can find the complete set at economicprinciples.org. While this table might look like a bunch of numbers and arrows at first glance, when you get into it a clearer picture will emerge.

But first, **here’s how to read the table and how these gauges work. The first column shows the determinant being measured. The second rates the quality of the gauge.** It is provided because for some of these important determinants we have good, clear measurements (e.g., for education, innovation and technology, cost competitiveness, productivity and output growth) and for some we don’t (e.g., acts of nature), and I want to show which is which. Additionally, there are other determinants that aren’t shown because they are either too subjective or too difficult to quantify (e.g., leadership). The quality of leadership can’t be measured as objectively as the amount of economic output (e.g., how can you measure whether Donald Trump was a good leader or a bad one?). Each is an aggregate of many indicators that I combined in the way that I felt best captured that particular determinant, giving consideration to both quantity and quality. For example, a country with a large population like China, India, and the United States when compared to a country with a small population like Singapore, the Netherlands, and Switzerland might have more of something but of lesser quality. I tried to structure these weightings so that I could imagine who would win if they had a competition like the Olympics or a war.

**Scanning the table, you can quickly get a picture of each country’s circumstances and the overall state of the world. For example, by looking at the empire scores and the arrows next to them you can see that the United States is the most powerful country but declining and China is close behind and rising quickly. You can see in what ways the United States is exceptionally strong—i.e., its reserve currency status, military strength, economic output, innovation and technology, and education—and you can see in what ways it is weak—i.e., its internal conflicts, wealth gaps, indebtedness, and expected economic growth.**

**You can also see that China is close behind the US in most other key areas and that it is relatively strong in its infrastructure and investment, innovation and technology, education, cost competitiveness, economic output, trade, military strength, and trade/capital flows, and relatively weak because of its reserve currency status, rule of law/corruption, and wealth gaps.** I find this data invaluable. It’s crucial to watch for changes in it when thinking about what’s happening and what is likely to happen.

For example, as shown before, **when 1) a country’s finances are deteriorating at the same time as 2) the level of internal conflict is high (e.g., over wealth and/or values differences), while 3) the country is being challenged by one or more strong foreign rivals, that typically produces 4) a mutually and self-reinforcing decline. That’s because the country’s deteriorating finances make it impossible for it to satisfy domestic spending needs and finance the war, which causes worse outcomes.**

Now that these things are quantified, we can see them happening in the table and make projections. The greater the number of important determinants that are worsening and the more severely they are worsening, the surer and more severe the decline will be. For example, if a few other determinants are weak and weakening at the same time that others are faltering, the expected severity of the decline increases. Because I, with the help of my computer, can monitor such things, I can assess a country’s relative health, vulnerabilities, and future prospects. For example, many of the most worrying conditions now exist in the United States, even though the United States is still the most powerful country in the world. That merits close attention.

As conveyed in some earlier charts, we saw that **1) these determinants tend to reinforce each other, whether in strength (e.g., stronger education tends to create stronger incomes) or weakness (e.g., weakening trade leads to higher indebtedness), so they tend to transpire in cycles that come together to create the Big Cycle, and 2) when the determinants are weak and weakening, the empires are weak and weakening.**9 **Big swings up occur when lots of determinants are strengthening and big swings down occur when lots of determinants are weakening.**

**Our computers use this data to generate written reports, which are available to read at economicprinciples.org. They project real GDP growth rates for the next 10 years, along with the gauge readings for each factor that leads to those estimates.** The data, and hence the projections, is more reliable for some countries than others, which is conveyed in the readouts. Still, they do a good job of reflecting the current health of a country and serve as leading indicators of their future health. Based on backtesting, these estimates would have predicted a country’s average growth rate over the next decade within 1 percent of the actual growth 59 percent of the time, and within 2 percent about 90 percent of the time, with a correlation to subsequent growth of 81 percent. I have found them to be invaluable.

While these are good and useful indicators, they have to work hand in hand with my thinking. Consider the question, “What is the mix of powers that makes a country powerful?” While the total power index at the top of the current readings tables is intended to indicate that and is arrived at via a weighted average of the indices below it, the truth is that the type of power that is most important to have at any one time varies according to circumstances. For example, military power is expensive and it typically sits around doing nothing until it is the most important power to have. How do I properly weight that against economic output that consists of mostly nonessentials? The answer is not well. I don’t have it modeled well, but I think about it a lot and apply my experience and intuition to it. In time I will have it modeled better, but I know that I will always need to have what is in my head work with what’s in the computer, as the computer and I need each other to be at our best.

### THE NEXT 10 YEARS
**While this book is about the really big cycles, I’d like to focus now on the dynamics within these cycles that will be most important over the next 10 years.** As I’ve explained, there are cycles within cycles within cycles, with the little ones adding up to the bigger ones, plus there are non-cyclical bumps that all together determine what happens. **Over the next 10 years, the most important dynamics are the short-term debt/money/economy cycle (also called the business cycle), the internal political cycle, and the escalating conflicts/reducing interdependencies between the US and China.** I find that keeping these cycles in mind, thinking about how they affect each other, and assessing where things stand within them are helpful for timing my decisions.

As discussed in Chapter 4, the short-term debt/money/economic cycle consists of alternating periods of central banks stimulating the economy by creating money and credit and then attempting to slowing it down by reducing the flow of them. They never get this precisely right, which is what produces the excesses that lead to bubbles, busts, and the cycle beginning again. Sometimes other negative events happen around the same time as a downturn—September 11, 2001 was such a case.

This cycle typically takes about eight years, give or take a few, though the timing is less the result of how long it’s been since the last one and more the result of the underlying economic drivers themselves. Most importantly, the amount of slack in the economy, the amounts and types of financial bubbles, the amount of central bank tightening, and the markets’ and economies’ sensitivity to tightening all matter. The last cycle began in April 2020 with largest dose of fiscal and monetary stimulation ever. The one before that began in 2008, which was also a giant dose though much less big. The ones before that began in 2001, 1990, 1982, 1980, 1974, 1970, 1960, etc. With the amounts of stimulation injected into this recent downturn being so enormous (especially in the US), with the slack in the major economies being relatively limited (especially in the US), with the signs of bubbles now being moderate to strong, and with the interest rate sensitivity of markets and the economy being high, my guess is that the next downturn will come sooner than is typical. I’d estimate in about four years from the publication of this book, give or take a couple of years (which is about five-and-a-half years from the bottom).

Don’t bet on what I just said happening because that configuration is not precise. I will need to monitor the factors I just mentioned, especially the rate of rebound in inflation and how quick and strong central bank tightening will be in order to home in on the precise timing. Also, I would expect any downturn to be promptly followed by a quick reversal of central bank policies toward the next big round of stimulation. That makes me less worried about the impact of the downturn and more worried about the excess money printing and the loss of value of money (particularly cash and debt in dollars, euros, and yen). Of course what happens in this economic cycle will be affected by what happens with the other cycles and the bumps along the way, just as this cycle will affect the other cycles.

As far as the internal order/disorder cycle is concerned, it typically lags the debt/economic cycle because people are less confrontational in good times than in bad ones. When these cycles interact strongly, it can lead to major changes. In the US the short-term political cycles of change come every two years with congressional elections and every four years with presidential elections, with an eight-year limit on the total presidential term. In China the changes come every five and 10 years with the next big one happening around the time of this book’s publication (November 2021). There is no limit on the presidential term. While we can look at the calendars and know something about what’s ahead, there will be lots of uncertainties, some of which can be really impactful. Based on my estimates, there is a significant chance the next downturn will come around the time of the next presidential election in the US.

The external order/disorder cycle has traditionally followed the path of accelerating conflicts that lead to wars. As mentioned earlier, the United States and China are now preparing themselves for increasing intensity in the five types of war. They are operating with roughly five-year plans to gain greater amounts of self-sufficiency and preparedness for each of these wars, which will give them greater ability to wage them, though it’s doubtful that either will become dominant enough to ignore the deterrent of mutually assured destruction. Since China’s strength is gaining relative to that of the US, it would seem to imply that important changes will come neither too soon nor too far ahead. As mentioned earlier, there is significant risk that we are approaching a conflict between an unstoppable force and an immovable object regarding Taiwan and the East and South China Seas—i.e., China is an unstoppable force for change to Taiwan’s current status and the United States is an immovable object against it. Beyond the US and China, other nations—most notably Russia, India, Japan, Korea, and the key European and Middle Eastern powers—will play important roles in this global drama. Over the next five years or so, alliances are likely to harden.

**These things point toward the next big risk point being around five years from this writing, give or take a couple of years.**

**To reiterate, there is nothing precise about the timing of these cycles.** They’re like hurricane/typhoon seasons; we know they are likely to happen at roughly certain times so we prepare for them, and when those times come, we watch for storms emerging, follow them closely, and do our best to get out of harm’s way. While we can’t say exactly when they will come and exactly how strong they will be, we do know that the trend and the fundamentals have been for them to get stronger, so we should be prepared for that possibility.

Despite all the analytical work I do, I know that the unknown is still much greater than the known. While history can be told pretty precisely, the future is exactly the opposite. I am not aware of a single case of the future being foretold accurately in any detail. For an investor, understanding history accurately is of no use relative to being a bit more right than wrong about the future. Since non-investors place bets in the form of their life decisions, that’s true for them too. That brings me to the final point of this chapter, which is about knowing how to place one’s bets based on the assumption that one is likely to be wrong a lot.

### DEALING WITH WHAT YOU KNOW AND WHAT YOU DON’T KNOW
Whatever success I’ve had has been more due to my knowing how to deal with what I don’t know than anything I know. Betting on the future is betting on probabilities and nothing is certain, not even the probabilities. That’s just the way it is. While what I’ve given you up until this point is what I believe I know about the future based on my reasoning about the past, what I want to pass along that is probably more important is how I make decisions in life and in the markets based on what I don’t know. In a nutshell, here’s what I try to do:

Know all the possibilities, think about the worst-case scenarios, and then find ways to eliminate the intolerable ones*. Identifying and eliminating the intolerable worst-case scenarios comes first. That’s because the most important thing in playing the game (of life or the markets) is to not get knocked out of it. I learned that from a big mistake I made in 1982, which nearly broke me. After that painful loss I calculated what my basic needs would cost and worked toward having enough money stashed away so my worst-case scenario would be tolerable. As I built up from nothing, I remember regularly calculating how many weeks, then months, and then years my family and I would be fine if not another dime came in. I now have an “end of the world” portfolio that I know will keep us fine in the worst-case scenarios, and I build from there. From reading this book, you can probably see that I imagine a lot of worst-case scenarios, including depressions, devaluations, revolutions, wars, pandemics, my big mistakes, health problems, and death from different causes. I start by trying to protect myself against all of them and more. While you might think that my paying so much attention to eliminating worst-case scenarios is depressing and prevents me from making the most of opportunities, the opposite is true. It’s liberating and exciting to operate this way because knowing that the worst-case scenarios are covered gives me the safety, freedom, and ability to go for great results.

* Diversify.* In addition to making sure I’ve covered all the worst-case scenarios I can think of, I try to cover those I can’t think of by diversifying well. I learned the math of it and I’m drawn to it instinctively. Essentially, if I have a bunch of bets that are attractive but unrelated, I can reduce my risks by up to 80 percent without reducing my upside at all. While this sounds like an investment strategy it’s actually an old and well-established good life strategy that I apply to investments as well. There is a Chinese saying that “a smart rabbit has three burrows,” meaning three places to go to in case any one of them becomes dangerous. This principle has saved many people’s lives when things got bad, and it’s one of my most important principles.

* Put deferred gratification ahead of immediate gratification so you will be better off in the future.*

* Triangulate among the smartest people possible.* I tag along with the smartest people I can find, so I can stress test my thinking and learn from them.

It is through these principles that I got so much upside with relatively little downside and a steadily improving future, albeit with bumps along the way. That’s why I recommend these principles to you, though as always, you should feel free to take them or leave them as you like.

One more thing for policy makers, those they report to, and others who are interested:

Use the gauges I gave you, or take the stats and make your own, to 1) measure the health of your country and other countries you’re interested in, 2) see if it is improving or worsening and in what ways, and 3) make changes in the determinants of the future to get a better future.

That’s it.

I now feel that doing all this has given me an adequate understanding of the possibilities, both worst-case scenarios and opportunities, and a time-tested plan for dealing with them well. I also believe that I have adequately conveyed to you in this book and on economicprinciples.org the most important things I know about how the lessons of the past can help you deal with the future. I hope you find them to be of some use. I plan to evolve all of this to make it better, which I hope we can do together.

May the Force of Evolution be with you,

*

### MORE DETAIL ON EACH OF THE GAUGES

**Education:** This gauge measures basic and higher education, split about evenly between the two. Half of the measure captures the absolute quantity of educated people at various levels and about half is placed on quality such as higher education rankings, test scores, and average years of education. The US ranks highest in this gauge (driven by strong absolute and relative measures of higher education), with China close behind (due to its large number of educated people).
**Innovation & Technology:** This gauge measures inventiveness, technological advancement, and entrepreneurship. It gives about half its weight to the country’s absolute share of key innovation metrics (e.g., patents, researchers, R&D spending, and venture capital funding) and half to a combination of external rankings and measures of innovation per capita (to help capture how widespread innovation is in the economy). The US is at the top of this measure due to its strength across a variety of metrics, while China ranks second due to its large share of global research spending, researchers, and patents. China is rising quickly in this area.
**Cost Competitiveness:** This gauge measures what one gets for what one pays. We want to see this because countries that produce the best at costs that are too expensive aren’t in good shape, even though they rank high in quality. We look at quality-adjusted and productivity-adjusted labor costs, along with other productivity measures. Major developing economies (particularly India) rank highest in this gauge, while the US ranks around the middle of the pack and European countries rank lowest (due to high labor costs).
**Infrastructure & Investment:** This gauge measures the quantity of infrastructure and investment spending and the quality of it. It captures a country’s absolute share of global investment, as well as the extent to which a country prioritizes quality of infrastructure and productivity-enhancing investments. The gauge weighs measures of investment as a share of world investment, overall infrastructure quality, investment and savings as a share of GDP, and logistics performance. China is currently the strongest according to this gauge (having risen sharply over the past 20 years) because of its high rates of productive investment relative to both the world and the size of its own past investment; the US is second, due largely to its high share of global productive investment, though it is worsening.
**Economic Output:** This gauge measures the strength of a country’s economic resources. We measure output primarily through GDP levels as a share of world total (adjusted for price differences across countries). We allocate some weight to GDP per capita rather than total GDP to capture quality. China ranks first in this gauge, insignificantly ahead of the US but also rising fastest, due its large PPP-adjusted GDP share. Europe ranks third.
**Expected Growth (Big Economic Cycle):** This gauge measures how well a country is positioned to grow its economy over the next 10 years. We look at a variety of metrics to estimate forward-looking 10-year economic growth, placing two-thirds weight on metrics that predict productivity and one-third on metrics that predict the impact of indebtedness on growth. Currently India is predicted to grow the fastest, followed by China, with the US predicted to grow a bit slower than average, and with Japan and a number of European countries predicted to grow least.
**Trade:** This gauge measures how strong of an exporter a country is. It looks at the absolute level of a country’s exports as a share of the world. China scores highest (being the largest exporter in the world), followed by Europe and the US.
**Military Strength:** This gauge is driven mostly by the absolute share of military spending and strength measured by the number of personnel, the number of nuclear weapons, and external indices of military capabilities. It does not look at military powers in varying regions or of various types, failing to capture some military superiorities Russia and China have in certain geographic areas, certain types of military technologies, or the role of alliances. The US is still the strongest overall military power based on these measures, with a strong lead in spending and a nuclear weapons program that is only rivaled by Russia. China is now ranked second and is rising quickly.
**Financial Center:** This gauge measures the level of development and sizes of a country’s financial markets and financial center. We look at absolute measures of transaction shares and market capitalizations, as well as external indices of financial center cities. The US remains the top-ranked power in this metric by a significant margin (driven primarily by its very large share of world equity and debt markets), with China and Europe ranking second and third, respectively.
**Reserve Currency Status:** This gauge measures the extent to which a country’s currency operates as a global reserve currency. We measure reserve currency status by the share of transactions, debts, and central bank reserves that are denominated or held in a country’s currency. Similar to financial center status, the US remains the top-ranked power in this metric by a significant margin, with Europe and Japan ranking second and third, respectively.
**Debt Burden (Big Economic Cycle):** This gauge is based on a combination of a) debt levels relative to asset levels, b) the sizes of external and internal surpluses and deficits, c) the sizes of debt service costs relative to GDP, d) the amount of debt in a country’s own currency versus foreign currency, e) the amount of debt held by its own citizens versus foreigners, and f) its credit rating. We composed it this way because it has proven itself to be the most reliable way we have of foreshadowing declines in the value of real wealth, whether they come in the form of debt defaults that result from not creating enough money and credit to satisfy excessive debt needs or devaluations that come from creating more than enough money and credit to satisfy excessive debt needs. I constructed this index to exclude reserve currency status so that I could see the exposure a country would have if it lost its reserve currency status.
**Internal Conflict (Internal Order):** This gauge looks at how much domestic conflict and discontent there is. It measures actual conflict events (e.g., protests), political conflict (e.g., partisanship), and general discontent (based on surveys). The US ranks highest in this gauge among the major countries, driven by measures of partisanship and higher incidence of internal conflict events, and it has been rising fast.
**Governance/Rule of Law:** This gauge measures the extent to which a country’s legal system is consistent, predictable, and conducive to growth and advancement. It combines rule of law measures (based primarily on business surveys of doing business in the country) and corruption measures (via a combination of external corruption indices and surveys of businesses). Russia and India score lowest (worst) on the gauge, while the UK, the Netherlands, and Japan score highest (best), with Germany and the US close behind.
**Geology:** This gauge measures each country’s geographic endowment, including land size and the value of its natural resources. It includes the total production of energy, agriculture, and industrial metals in order to capture the absolute production capacity of each nation, as well as net exports to capture relative self-reliance for each of the categories (in addition to measuring some other natural resources like freshwater supply). Russia and the US score highest (followed by China, which relies more on the rest of the world to cover its natural resource needs), while Japan and the UK score lowest.
**Gaps in Wealth, Opportunity & Values:** This gauge measures how big the gaps in wealth/income, opportunities, and values are. It combines measures of both a) wealth and income inequality (e.g., how much does the top 1 percent have versus the rest) and b) political conflict (e.g., how split is the legislature on ideology). India, the US, and China score worst because of very large wealth and income gaps (and in the case of the US also significant political gaps). At the other end of the spectrum are the European nations and Japan, which generally speaking have lower income and wealth inequality.
**Character/Civility/Determination:** This gauge attempts to measure to what extent the attitudes of each country’s people create an environment that’s supportive to civility and hard work, which supports growth and advancement. It uses a) surveys around attitudes toward working hard and success and b) other measures that proxy how much a society values self-sufficiency and work (e.g., government transfer payments size, effective retirement age) to quantify this. China and India score highest (the US is third), and the European countries (notably Spain and France) score lowest.
**Resource-Allocation Efficiency:** This gauge attempts to measure how efficiently each country is using its labor and capital. It looks at whether the country has chronically high unemployment (i.e., not finding efficient ways to employ its people), if debt growth generates commensurate income growth over time, and external indices and surveys about the rigidity of the labor market and ease of getting loans. Much of Europe (particularly France and Spain) score lowest on these measures, while the US and Germany score near the top. Developing countries (particularly Russia, but also China and India) also score fairly well in this measure—as generally speaking they produce more income growth per unit of debt growth.
**Acts of Nature:** This gauge measures how vulnerable to and impacted by acts of nature each country is. While it is difficult to quantify all the various acts of nature that might affect a country, we used expert assessments of future climate change impact on each country’s GDP, external assessments of each country’s preparedness for natural disasters, and the outcomes from the COVID pandemic (as that was a real-time test against an act of nature). I consider this rating so-so and find that there is still a lot more we want to capture to make this gauge better, hence its low quality.
**External Conflict:** While not a part of the model for individual countries, the external conflict gauge measures the levels of economic, political/cultural, and military conflict between pairs of major countries. Within each category, we tried to come up with a mix of structural indicators (to establish a baseline level of conflict between countries) and timely indicators (to flag major escalations above that baseline). For example, for economic conflict we track bilateral trade between countries, tariff rates, and timely news around sanctions, trade wars, etc.

1 Importantly, a number of the charts shown on these pages rely on the record from fewer countries further in the past, due to limited reliable data history. Life expectancy prior to the 1800s is solely based on Great Britain (marked by the dotted line). Global RGDP is primarily a mix of European countries before 1870. And there are not good records of total wealth prior to the 1900s, so I can’t show you the picture before then.

3 Arrows denote the 20-year change in the gauge.

4 As a result, debt assets (especially cash) will probably perform poorly and debt liabilities will probably be good to have, especially if invested in profitable, disruptive technologies and solid investments that have higher returns than the cost of funding them.

5 Individual European countries are not shown on the reserve currency status gauge due to the European Monetary Union (all these countries use the euro)—so only the Europe aggregate is shown. The measure shows an average of what share of global transactions, debts, and official central bank reserve holdings are denominated in each country’s currency.

6 In 1919, over 20 percent of the US labor force went on strike.

7 There have been just over 50 wars between great powers since 1500, per Steven Pinker’s The Better Angels of Our Nature* (2011). Eighty percent of the years before 1800 had wars; it’s been 20 percent since.

8 We *may* be seeing such a buildup now. China’s military spending has risen sharply in dollar terms over the past decade, though as a share of GDP it remains relatively steady (at around 2 percent). At around 3 percent of GDP, military spending has fallen a bit for the US.

9 Determinants like geology (i.e., minerals in the ground) are relatively easy to measure, though the implications of having them might change. Determinants that evolve like humanity’s innovations and technologies can typically be seen emerging by watching the trends. Those that transpire in cycles (like debt and capital markets) can be understood by understanding the cycles. The fact that acts of nature like pandemics, droughts, and floods come along shouldn’t be a surprise, though their timing often is.
