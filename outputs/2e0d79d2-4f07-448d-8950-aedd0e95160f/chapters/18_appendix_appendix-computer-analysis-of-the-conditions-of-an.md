# Appendix: Computer Analysis of the Conditions of, and Prospects for, the World’s Leading Countries

Appendix

## APPENDIX COMPUTER ANALYSIS OF THE CONDITIONS OF, AND PROSPECTS FOR, THE WORLD’S LEADING COUNTRIES
As I described earlier, I feed data into a computer that can create an output summarizing the conditions of, and long-term prospects for, the world’s leading countries. These computer-generated summaries follow on the next few pages. I use these outputs to supplement my own thinking and other computer models I run to help me understand the world. This system is a never-ending work in progress. I will update these summaries on economicprinciples.org at least annually or more frequently if any big changes take place.

The text for each country highlights a few of the major gauges and a few of the stats within each gauge that reflect the broad trends we are seeing. The aggregate gauges and final country power score I am showing include hundreds of individual stats that we aggregate based on relevance, quality, and consistency across countries and time. To best capture the overall strength of a country, I gave considerations to both quantity and quality, but structured things to best capture who would win in a competition or war.

### THE POWERS AND PROSPECTS OF THE UNITED STATES
This is our computer-generated reading for the United States as of August 2021.**

Based on the latest readings of key indicators, **the United States appears to be a strong power (No. 1 among major countries today) in gradual decline. As shown in the table, the key strengths of the United States that put it in this position are its strong capital markets and financial center, its innovation/technology, its high level of education, its strong military, its reserve currency status, and its high economic output. Its weaknesses are its unfavorable economic/financial position and its large domestic conflicts.** The eight major measures of power are very strong today but are, in aggregate, trending downward. In particular, the United States’ relative position in education, its importance to global trade, and its relative military strength are declining.

The table shows our aggregate country power gauge and the major drivers, as well as the rank of each measure of power across 11 major countries today and the trajectory over the past 20 years.

To understand a country, we start by looking at **the big cycles**, as well as **measures of power** that both reflect and drive the rise and fall of a country. While we refer to these factors individually, they are not separate; they interact with and reinforce one another to move a country along its cycle.

For the United States, **the big cycles look unfavorable**.

**The United States is in an unfavorable position in its economic and financial cycles**, with a high debt burden and relatively low expected real growth over the next 10 years (1.1 percent per year). The United States has significantly more foreign debts than foreign assets (net IIP is -64 percent of GDP). Non-financial debt levels are high (277 percent of GDP), and government debt levels are high (128 percent of GDP). The bulk of these debts (99 percent) are in its own currency, which mitigates its debt risks. The ability to use interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy is low (short rates at 0.1 percent), and the country is already printing money to monetize debt. That said, being the world’s leading reserve currency is extremely beneficial to the US. If this were to change, it would significantly weaken the US position.

**Internal disorder is a high risk.** Wealth, income, and values gaps are large. Regarding inequality, the top 1 percent and top 10 percent in the United States capture 19 percent and 45 percent of income (both the second highest shares across major countries). Our internal conflict gauge is very high. This gauge measures actual conflict events (e.g., protests), political conflict (e.g., partisanship), and general discontent (based on surveys).

**External disorder is a risk.** Most importantly, the United States and China, which is fast-rising and the No. 2 power (all things considered), are having significant conflict.

**Looking in more detail at the eight key measures of power, the United States has the largest capital markets and the strongest financial center among major countries.** Its equity markets are a majority of the world total (55 percent of total market cap and 64 percent of volume), and a majority of global transactions happen in dollars (55 percent). **In addition, the United States has the strongest reading on our measures of technology and innovation among major countries.** A large share of global patent applications (17 percent), global R&D spending (26 percent), and global researchers (26 percent) are in the United States. **The United States also has the strongest position in education among major countries.** The United States has a large share of the world’s bachelor’s degrees (20 percent). On years of education, the United States is good—students have on average 13.7 years of education versus 11.5 in the average major country. PISA scores, which measure the proficiency of 15-year-old students across countries, are around average—495 versus 483 in the average major country. The United States also has a mix of other strengths, as detailed in the table.

### THE POWERS AND PROSPECTS OF CHINA
**This is our computer-generated reading for China as of August 2021.**

Based on the latest readings of key indicators, **China appears to be a strong power (No. 2 among major countries today) in rapid ascent. As shown in the table, the key strengths of China that put it in this position are its strong economic and financial position, its infrastructure and investment, its importance to global trade, its high economic output, its people’s self-sufficiency and strong work ethic, its high level of education, and its strong military.** The eight major measures of power are somewhat strong today and are, in aggregate, trending sharply upward. In particular, China’s importance to global trade, its innovation and technology, and its importance as a financial center are increasing.

The table shows our aggregate country power gauge and the major drivers, as well as the rank of each measure of power across 11 major countries today and the trajectory over the past 20 years.

To understand a country, we start by looking at the **big cycles**, as well as **measures of power** that both reflect and drive the rise and fall of a country. While we refer to these factors individually, they are not separate; they interact with and reinforce one another to move a country along its cycle.

For China, **the big cycles look somewhat favorable**.

**China is in a somewhat favorable position in its economic and financial cycles**, with a low debt burden and relatively high expected real growth over the next 10 years (4.3 percent per year). China has slightly more foreign assets than foreign debts (net IIP is 12 percent of GDP). Non-financial debt levels are high (263 percent of GDP), though government debt levels are low (48 percent of GDP). The bulk of these debts (96 percent) are in its own currency, which mitigates its debt risks. The ability to use interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy is modest (short rates at 1.9 percent).

**Internal disorder is a moderate risk.** Wealth, income, and values gaps are relatively large. Regarding inequality, the top 1 percent and top 10 percent in China capture 14 percent and 41 percent of income (respectively the third and fourth highest shares across major countries). Our internal conflict gauge is average. This gauge measures actual conflict events (e.g., protests), political conflict (e.g., partisanship), and general discontent (based on surveys).

**External disorder is a risk.** Most importantly, China and the United States, which is declining but remains the No. 1 power (all things considered), are having significant conflict.

**Looking in more detail at the eight key measures of power, China is the largest exporter among major countries.** It exports 14 percent of global exports. **In addition, China has the largest economy among major countries.** A large share of global economic activity (22 percent; adjusted for differences in prices across countries) is in China. **China also has the second strongest position in education among major countries.** China has a large share of the world’s bachelor’s degrees (22 percent). China also has a mix of other strengths, as detailed in the table.

### THE POWERS AND PROSPECTS OF THE EUROZONE
**This is our computer-generated reading for the Eurozone as of August 2021.**

Based on the latest readings of key indicators, **the Eurozone appears to be a strong power (No. 3 among major countries today) on a flat trajectory. As shown in the table, the key strengths of the Eurozone are its importance to global trade and its reserve currency status. Its weaknesses are its people’s lower-than-average work ethic and low self-sufficiency and its relatively poor allocation of labor and capital.** The eight major measures of power are somewhat strong today but are, in aggregate, moving sideways.

The table shows our aggregate country power gauge and the major drivers, as well as the rank of each measure of power across 11 major countries today and the trajectory over the past 20 years.

To understand a country, we start by looking at **the big cycles**, as well as **measures of power** that both reflect and drive the rise and fall of a country. While we refer to these factors individually, they are not separate; they interact with and reinforce one another to move a country along its cycle.

For the Eurozone, **the big cycles look mixed**.

**The Eurozone is in a moderately unfavorable position in its economic and financial cycles**, with a moderately high debt burden and relatively low expected real growth over the next 10 years (0.3 percent per year). The Eurozone has similar levels of foreign debts and foreign assets (net IIP is 0 percent of GDP). Non-financial debt levels are high (241 percent of GDP), though government debt levels are typical for major countries today (104 percent of GDP). The ability to use interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy is very low (short rates at -0.5 percent), and Europe is already printing money to monetize debt.

**Internal disorder is a low risk.** Wealth, income, and values gaps are typical. Regarding inequality, the top 1 percent and top 10 percent in the Eurozone capture 11 percent and 35 percent of income (respectively the eighth and seventh highest shares across major countries). Our internal conflict gauge is average. This gauge measures actual conflict events (e.g., protests), political conflict (e.g., partisanship), and general discontent (based on surveys).

**Looking in more detail at the eight key measures of power, the Eurozone is the second largest exporter among major countries.** It exports 12 percent of global exports. **In addition, the Eurozone has the second strongest reserve currency among major countries.** A large share of global currency reserves are in euros (21 percent), and a large share of global debt is denominated in euros (22 percent).

This summary reflects our estimate of the power of the Eurozone in aggregate. For most stats, we're using an aggregate across the eight major countries in the Eurozone.*

### THE POWERS AND PROSPECTS OF GERMANY
**This is our computer-generated reading for Germany as of August 2021.**

Based on the latest readings of key indicators, **Germany appears to be a middle-of-the-pack power (No. 4 among major countries today) on a flat trajectory. As shown in the table, the key strengths of Germany are its strong economic and financial position and its high internal order.** The eight major measures of power are somewhat strong today but are, in aggregate, moving sideways.

The table shows our aggregate country power gauge and the major drivers, as well as the rank of each measure of power across 11 major countries today and the trajectory over the past 20 years.

To understand a country, we start by looking at **the big cycles**, as well as **measures of power** that both reflect and drive the rise and fall of a country. While we refer to these factors individually, they are not separate; they interact with and reinforce one another to move a country along its cycle.

For Germany, **the big cycles look mostly favorable**.

**Germany is in a somewhat favorable position in its economic and financial cycles**, with a low debt burden but very low expected real growth over the next 10 years (0.3 percent per year). Germany has significantly more foreign assets than foreign debts (net IIP is 71 percent of GDP). Non-financial debt levels are typical for major countries today (183 percent of GDP), as are government debt levels for major countries today (69 percent of GDP). Germany’s debts are largely in euros, which increases Germany’s debt risks, since this is not a currency that Germany directly controls. The ability to use interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy is low for the Eurozone (short rates are at -0.5 percent), and Europe is already printing money to monetize debt.

**On the eight key measures of power, Germany looks somewhat strong in aggregate. It has no particularly prominent strengths or weaknesses that I will call out.**

### THE POWERS AND PROSPECTS OF JAPAN
**This is our computer-generated reading for Japan as of August 2021.**

Based on the latest readings of key indicators, **Japan appears to be a modest power (No. 5 among major countries today) in gradual decline. As shown in the table, the key strength of Japan is its high internal order. Its weaknesses are its unfavorable economic/financial position and its relative lack of natural resources.** The eight major measures of power are somewhat strong today but are, in aggregate, trending downward. In particular, Japan’s share of global output, its importance to global trade, and its innovation and technology are declining.

The table shows our aggregate country power gauge and the major drivers, as well as the rank of each measure of power across 11 major countries today and the trajectory over the past 20 years.

To understand a country, we start by looking at **the big cycles**, as well as **measures of power** that both reflect and drive the rise and fall of a country.

For Japan, **the big cycles look mixed**.

**Japan is in an unfavorable position in its economic and financial cycles**, with a moderately high debt burden and very low expected real growth over the next 10 years (0 percent per year). Japan has significantly more foreign assets than foreign debts (net IIP is 68 percent of GDP). Non-financial debt levels are very high (400 percent of GDP), as are government debt levels (241 percent of GDP). The bulk of these debts (99 percent) are in its own currency, which mitigates its debt risks. The ability to use interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy is very low (short rates at -0.1 percent), and the country is already printing money to monetize debt.

### THE POWERS AND PROSPECTS OF INDIA
**This is our computer-generated reading for India as of August 2021.**

Based on the latest readings of key indicators, **India appears to be a modest power (No. 6 among major countries today) in gradual ascent. As shown in the table, the key strengths of India are its strong economic and financial position and its cost-competitive labor (on a quality-adjusted basis). Its weaknesses are its large domestic conflicts, its weak relative position in education, its bad reading on innovation and technology, its corruption and inconsistent rule of law, and its lack of reserve currency status.** The eight major measures of power are somewhat strong today and are, in aggregate, trending upward. In particular, India’s relative military strength, its innovation and technology, and its importance to global trade are increasing.

The table shows our aggregate country power gauge and the major drivers, as well as the rank of each measure of power across 11 major countries today and the trajectory over the past 20 years.

To understand a country, we start by looking at **the big cycles**, as well as **measures of power** that both reflect and drive the rise and fall of a country. While we refer to these factors individually, they are not separate; they interact with and reinforce one another to move a country along its cycle.

For India, **the big cycles look mixed**.

**India is in a highly favorable position in its economic and financial cycles**, with a moderately low debt burden and high expected real growth over the next 10 years (6.3 percent per year). India has slightly more foreign debts than foreign assets (net IIP is -12 percent of GDP). Non-financial debt levels are low (125 percent of GDP), though government debt levels are typical for major countries today (75 percent of GDP). The bulk of these debts (91 percent) are in its own currency, which mitigates its debt risks. The ability to use interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy is modest (short rates at 3.4 percent).

**Internal disorder is a high risk.** Wealth, income, and values gaps are large. Regarding inequality, the top 1 percent and top 10 percent in India capture 21 percent and 56 percent of income (both the highest shares across major countries). However, a wide wealth gap is less concerning in a fast growing country like India because the fast growth can create rising prosperity for all.

**Looking in more detail at the eight key measures of power, India has the cheapest labor among major countries.** Adjusted for worker quality, labor is significantly cheaper than the global average.

**We net this against its weak relative position in education, its bad reading on innovation and technology, and its lack of reserve currency status.** On years of education, India is bad—students have on average 5.8 years of education versus 11.5 in the average major country. PISA scores, which measure the proficiency of 15-year-old students across countries, are bad—336 versus 483 in the average major country. With innovation and technology, a small share (less than 1 percent) of global patent applications, a small share (3 percent) of global R&D spending, and a moderate share (3 percent) of global researchers are in India.

### THE POWERS AND PROSPECTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
**This is our computer-generated reading for the United Kingdom as of August 2021.**

Based on the latest readings of key indicators, **the United Kingdom appears to be a modest power (in the bottom half of major countries today) on a flat trajectory. As shown in the table, the key strength of the United Kingdom is its strong rule of law/low corruption. Its weaknesses are its unfavorable economic/financial position and its relative lack of natural resources.** The eight major measures of power are somewhat weak today and are, in aggregate, moving sideways.

The table shows our aggregate country power gauge and the major drivers, as well as the rank of each measure of power across 11 major countries today and the trajectory over the past 20 years.

To understand a country, we start by looking at **the big cycles**, as well as **measures of power** that both reflect and drive the rise and fall of a country. While we refer to these factors individually, they are not separate; they interact with and reinforce one another to move a country along its cycle.

For the United Kingdom, **the big cycles look mostly unfavorable**.

**The UK is in an unfavorable position in its economic and financial cycles**, with a high debt burden and relatively low expected real growth over the next 10 years (0.9 percent per year). The UK has modestly more foreign debts than foreign assets (net IIP is -28 percent of GDP). Non-financial debt levels are high (260 percent of GDP), though government debt levels are typical for major countries today (106 percent of GDP). The bulk of these debts (90 percent) are in its own currency, which mitigates its debt risks. The ability to use interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy is low (short rates at 0.1 percent), and the country is already printing money to monetize debt.

### THE POWERS AND PROSPECTS OF FRANCE
**This is our computer-generated reading for France as of August 2021.**

Based on the latest readings of key indicators, **France appears to be a modest power (in the bottom half of major countries today) on a flat trajectory. As shown in the table, the key weaknesses of France that put it in this position are its unfavorable economic/financial position, its people’s lower-than-average work ethic and low self-sufficiency, and its relatively poor allocation of labor and capital.** The eight major measures of power are somewhat weak today and are, in aggregate, moving sideways.

The table shows our aggregate country power gauge and the major drivers, as well as the rank of each measure of power across 11 major countries today and the trajectory over the past 20 years.

To understand a country, we start by looking at **the big cycles**, as well as **measures of power** that both reflect and drive the rise and fall of a country. While we refer to these factors individually, they are not separate; they interact with and reinforce one another to move a country along its cycle.

For France, **the big cycles look mostly unfavorable**.

**France is in an unfavorable position in its economic and financial cycles**, with a moderately high debt burden and relatively low expected real growth over the next 10 years (0.4 percent per year). France has slightly more foreign debts than foreign assets (net IIP is -25 percent of GDP). Non-financial debt levels are high (268 percent of GDP), though government debt levels are typical for major countries today (105 percent of GDP). France’s debts are largely in euros, which increases France’s debt risks, since this is not a currency that France directly controls. The ability to use interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy is low for the Eurozone (short rates are at -0.5 percent), and Europe is already printing money to monetize debt.

**Internal disorder is a low risk.** Wealth, income, and values gaps are narrow. Regarding inequality, the top 1 percent and top 10 percent in France capture 10 percent and 32 percent of income (both the ninth highest shares across major countries). Our internal conflict gauge is average. This gauge measures actual conflict events (e.g., protests), political conflict (e.g., partisanship), and general discontent (based on surveys).

**On the eight key measures of power, France looks somewhat weak in aggregate. It has no particularly prominent strengths or weaknesses that I will call out.**

### THE POWERS AND PROSPECTS OF THE NETHERLANDS
**This is our computer-generated reading for the Netherlands as of August 2021.**

Based on the latest readings of key indicators, **the Netherlands appears to be a modest power (in the bottom half of major countries today) on a flat trajectory. As shown in the table, the key strengths of the Netherlands are its high internal order and its strong rule of law/low corruption. Its weaknesses are its relatively weak military and its relatively expensive labor (on a quality-adjusted basis).** The eight major measures of power are somewhat weak today and are, in aggregate, moving sideways.

The table shows our aggregate country power gauge and the major drivers, as well as the rank of each measure of power across 11 major countries today and the trajectory over the past 20 years.

For the Netherlands, **the big cycles look somewhat favorable**.

**The Netherlands is in a somewhat favorable position in its economic and financial cycles**, with a low debt burden but relatively low expected real growth over the next 10 years (1 percent per year). The Netherlands has significantly more foreign assets than foreign debts (net IIP is 90 percent of GDP). Non-financial debt levels are high (286 percent of GDP), though government debt levels are low (53 percent of GDP). The Netherlands’ debts are largely in euros, which increases the Netherlands’ debt risks, since this is not a currency that the Netherlands directly controls. The ability to use interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy is low for the Eurozone (short rates are at -0.5 percent), and Europe is already printing money to monetize debt.

**Internal disorder is a low risk.** Wealth, income, and values gaps are narrow. Regarding inequality, the top 1 percent and top 10 percent in the Netherlands capture 7 percent and 29 percent of income (both the 10th highest shares across major countries). Our internal conflict gauge is low. This gauge measures actual conflict events (e.g., protests), political conflict (e.g., partisanship), and general discontent (based on surveys).

**Looking in more detail at the eight key measures of power, we would call out its relatively weak military and its relatively expensive labor (on a quality-adjusted basis).** A small share of global military spending (less than 1 percent) is by the Netherlands, and it has a small share of the world’s military personnel (less than 1 percent). With labor cost, once we adjust for worker quality, labor is somewhat more expensive than the global average.

### THE POWERS AND PROSPECTS OF RUSSIA
**This is our computer-generated reading for Russia as of August 2021.**

Based on the latest readings of key indicators, **Russia appears to be a modest power (in the bottom half of major countries today) on a flat trajectory. As shown in the table, the key strengths of Russia are its strong economic and financial position, its wealth of natural resources, and its relatively strong military. Its weaknesses are its relatively small economy, its corruption and inconsistent rule of law, and its relative unimportance as a global financial center.** The eight major measures of power are somewhat weak today and are, in aggregate, moving sideways.

The table shows our aggregate country power gauge and the major drivers, as well as the rank of each measure of power across 11 major countries today and the trajectory over the past 20 years.

For Russia, **the big cycles look somewhat favorable**.

**Russia is in a somewhat favorable position in its economic and financial cycles**, with a low debt burden and modest expected real growth over the next 10 years (2.5 percent per year). Russia has modestly more foreign assets than foreign debts (net IIP is 33 percent of GDP). Non-financial debt levels are low (99 percent of GDP), as are government debt levels (14 percent of GDP). A significant share of Russia’s debt (25 percent) is denominated in foreign currencies, which increases its debt risks. The ability to use interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy is high (short rates at 6.6 percent).

**Internal disorder is a moderate risk.** Our internal conflict gauge is average. This gauge measures actual conflict events (e.g., protests), political conflict (e.g., partisanship), and general discontent (based on surveys).

**Looking in more detail at the eight key measures of power, Russia has a relatively strong military.** A moderate share of global military spending (7 percent) is by Russia, and it has a moderately large share of the world’s military personnel (13 percent).

**We net this against its relatively small economy and its relative unimportance as a global financial center.** Russia’s equity markets are a small share of the world total (less than 1 percent of total market cap and less than 1 percent of volume).

### THE POWERS AND PROSPECTS OF SPAIN
**This is our computer-generated reading for Spain as of August 2021.**

Based on the latest readings of key indicators, **Spain appears to be a modest power (in the bottom half of major countries today) on a flat trajectory. As shown in the table, the key weaknesses of Spain that put it in this position are its unfavorable economic/financial position, its relatively poor allocation of labor and capital, its relative unimportance to global trade, and its bad reading on innovation and technology.** The eight major measures of power are somewhat weak today and are, in aggregate, moving sideways.

For Spain, **the big cycles look mostly unfavorable**.

**Spain is in an unfavorable position in its economic and financial cycles**, with a high debt burden and very low expected real growth over the next 10 years (0 percent per year). Spain has significantly more foreign debts than foreign assets (net IIP is -73 percent of GDP). Non-financial debt levels are high (249 percent of GDP), as are government debt levels (114 percent of GDP). Spain’s debts are largely in euros, which increases Spain’s debt risks, since this is not a currency that Spain directly controls.

**Internal disorder is a moderate risk.** Wealth, income, and values gaps are typical. Regarding inequality, the top 1 percent and top 10 percent in Spain capture 12 percent and 34 percent of income (respectively the seventh and eighth highest shares across major countries). Our internal conflict gauge is average. This gauge measures actual conflict events (e.g., protests), political conflict (e.g., partisanship), and general discontent (based on surveys).

**Looking in more detail at the eight key measures of power, we would call out its relative unimportance to global trade and its bad reading on innovation and technology.** Spain accounts for just 2 percent of global exports. With innovation and technology, small shares of global patent applications (less than 1 percent), global R&D spending (1 percent), and global researchers (1 percent) are in Spain.
