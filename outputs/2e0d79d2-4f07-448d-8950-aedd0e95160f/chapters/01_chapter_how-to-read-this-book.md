# HOW TO READ THIS BOOK

In writing this book I wrestled with whether to make it complete or concise and decided to try to make it both by bolding passages to create a quick-read version. If you want to read the concise version, read what is in bold, and if you want more, itâ€™s all available to you.**
I also wanted to convey some principles that are timeless and universal truths for dealing with reality well, which I denoted by * putting a red dot in front of them and italicizing*.
For some subjects, I had embellishments that I thought would be interesting to some but not all readers, so I chose to present them as an addendum to the respective chapter. Feel free to read or skip as you like.
At the back of this book, you can find a glossary that explains the abbreviations you see in some of the charts.
Finally, to keep this book from becoming much too long, there is also a lot of supplemental material available at economicprinciples.org, including reference material, citations, more data on the indices, etc.
