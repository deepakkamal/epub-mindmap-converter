Chapter 9: The Big Cycle Rise and Decline of the Dutch Empire and the Guilder

**

## CHAPTER 9 THE BIG CYCLE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE DUTCH EMPIRE AND THE GUILDER
After a series of attempted revolts in the mid-1500s, the Dutch, who were under the control of Habsburg Spain, finally became powerful enough to gain de facto independence in 1581. From 1625 until their collapse in 1795, the Dutch gained enough wealth and power to eclipse both the Habsburgs and China as the world’s richest empire.**

**The Dutch Empire rose for all the classic reasons explained in earlier chapters, peaking around 1650 in what is now remembered as the Dutch Golden Age.** While its small population and territorial footprint prevented it from being the dominant military power on the European continent, it more than made up for that through a combination of economic strength, financial sophistication, and a strong navy that could protect its large empire of trading posts and colonies around the world. This allowed its currency, the Dutch guilder, to emerge as the first global reserve currency.

The following chart shows the eight powers that fueled the Dutch ascent and eventual decline.

*
What the chart doesn’t show is the decline of the prior leading power, the Habsburg Empire, which you can see in the next chart depicting the entire arc of the Dutch Empire with key events noted. The numbers mark the approximate times of the six stages of the internal order cycle.

The story begins with the decline of the Spanish Habsburgs, which initiated the first stage of the Dutch Big Cycle.

### The Transition from the Spanish/Habsburg Empire to the Dutch Empire
New empires rise when old ones become weak and decadent. The story of the Dutch Empire began when the Habsburg Empire became weak, decadent, and overextended in all the classic ways.

From 1519 until 1556, the Holy Roman emperor and head of the Habsburg Empire was Charles V. The union of territories he controlled—which included most of modern-day Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Austria, and Spain—made the Habsburg Empire the most powerful family empire in Europe. **Spain was especially** **strong**1 **because of the wealth and power it acquired in the Age of Exploration.** The Spanish fleet was clearly the most powerful navy in Europe. Spanish silver coinage came close to being a reserve currency—it was used as far afield as China. Things began to change around the mid-1500s as **the seeds of decline that were planted in the top phase began to germinate and a revolutionary shift in power began to brew**.

**The decline of the Habsburgs happened in many of the classic ways. There were revolutions against the elites who held wealth and power by those without them, challenging the existing order. For example, as I explained in the previous chapter, new religious ideas surfaced in the form of the Reformation, a revolution against the Roman Catholic Church, which was perceived as decadent and exploitative.** At the time, the Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire were a rich and powerful political force that was integral to the existing order. **The revolution started when a collection of religious opposition groups known generally as Protestantism challenged the system.** Martin Luther published his Ninety-Five Theses* in 1517, challenging the papal interpretation of the Bible and papal power in general. When Luther refused to recant, he was declared a heretic and excommunicated. His ideas nonetheless took hold in large parts of Europe, thanks to the political support of key nobles, as well as Europe’s new printing press technology.

**This came at an economically difficult time, when conflicts were intensifying, leading to instability and terrible civil wars,**2 **eventually culminating in the brutal Thirty Years’ War in the mid-1600s. Its biggest negative impact was on the Holy Roman Empire and the Habsburgs.**

Charles V failed to prevent the revolutionary impacts of the Reformation and with it the damage to the existing order. He was forced to sign the Peace of Augsburg in 1555, which weakened the Holy Roman Empire and the Habsburg dynasty. He abdicated and divided his holdings in two: the Holy Roman Empire, which he passed to his brother Ferdinand, and most of the rest of the Habsburg Empire—most importantly Spain, but also the Netherlands, Belgium, significant portions of Italy, and Spanish colonies abroad—which he passed on to his son Philip II. From that point forward, the decline followed the classic script:

**The empire was overextended militarily.** Not only did Spain face a lengthy revolt against its unpopular rule in the Netherlands, it also fought with the Ottoman Empire, various Italian states, the French, and the British. These wars were costly and chipped away at the Habsburg family dynasty even before the Thirty Years’ War.
**Terrible national finances caused the classic toxic mix of increased taxation, money printing, and rising debt.** Philip II defaulted on debts four times during his reign.
**The lower and middle classes suffered from rising food prices**, which were increasing at an unprecedented rate from the Spanish Price Revolution.
**Internal conflict grew**, for all the previously mentioned reasons.
**Leadership deteriorated.** Philip II and his son Philip III preferred lavish living to governing and ultimately used money printing to cover the large deficits, which led to high inflation and economic pain. Those around them behaved similarly.

This chart shows the value of the most popular commonly circulating coin in silver terms. Adding cheap base metals to the monetary supply was the popular way to “print” and devalue money at the time. You can see it started in the early 1600s.

*
The events of the 1500s were not the end of the Habsburg Empire, nor even to its claim to control the Netherlands—that wouldn’t happen until the end of the Thirty Years’ War in 1648. But they did create the conditions that allowed the Dutch to rise.

### THE RISE
**From 1581 until around 1625, the Dutch Empire was built following the classic steps of a rising empire outlined in Chapter 1. More specifically:**

Led by William the Silent, the Dutch successfully revolted against Spain in the Eighty Years’ War, which resulted in the Dutch Republic asserting its independence in 1581. William, who was basically the father of the Netherlands, was a skilled military commander and united the various Dutch provinces against the Spanish.
While the Spanish and the Dutch continued to fight over the subsequent decades, the Dutch were able to gain independence and the seeds were sown for the rise of a more unified Dutch Republic (particularly as Philip II cut off trade with the Dutch, forcing them to expand abroad on their own).
**Because the republic was set up to allow each of the underlying provinces to maintain a high degree of sovereignty, the rise of the Dutch Empire was driven by a collective of statesmen rather than by a single monarch or leader.** Though nobles held the most important roles, this system created checks and balances and a partnership that proved effective.
**Dutch values and culture emphasized education, saving, merit, and tolerance.**
The break from Spain allowed the Dutch to create a **more open and inventive society.**
**The Dutch invented ships that could go around the world to collect riches, capitalism that could finance these and other productive endeavors, and many more breakthroughs that made them rich and powerful. The Dutch created the world’s first mega-corporation, the Dutch East India Company, which accounted for about one-third of world trade.**3 **Dutch openness to new ideas, people, and technology helped them rise quickly.**
To support trade **the Dutch government increased military investments**, which allowed the country to control still more trade by holding off the British in a number of military conflicts.
**The Dutch also created the world’s first reserve currency other than gold and silver, the Dutch guilder, supported by** **an innovative banking and currency system put into place via the establishment of the Bank of Amsterdam.**4

**As a result of these classic and sound fundamental steps, the Dutch became rich—income per capita in the Netherlands rose to over twice that of most other European powers. The Dutch continued to invest heavily in education and infrastructure to build on their successes.** Dutch literacy rates reached twice the world average. They continued to develop their capital markets and **Amsterdam became the world’s most important financial center**. The Dutch did all of this with a population of only 1–2 million people.

The following charts provide some perspective on the unique nature of Dutch education, innovation, and trade in the 1600s and the impact these forces had on Dutch incomes, all of which we will explore later in this chapter.

**In short, the Dutch were superbly educated people who were very hardworking and inventive—**in fact, they came up with about a quarter of all major inventions in the world when they were at their peak, a spike that began shortly before Dutch independence from Spain.

**To reiterate, the two most important inventions they came up with were 1) uniquely effective sailing ships that could take them all around the world, which, with the military skills they acquired** **from the fighting they did in Europe, allowed them to collect great riches, and 2) the capitalism that fueled these endeavors.**

#### The Capital Markets Cycle of the Dutch
**The Dutch invented capitalism as we know it. This was great for the Dutch and great for the world, but like most great inventions, it brought with it some potentially deadly consequences.** While production, trade, and private ownership had existed before, **the ability of large numbers of people to collectively buy ownership in money-making endeavors through public equity markets did not exist. The Dutch created that when they invented the world’s first publicly listed company (the Dutch East India Company) and the first stock exchange in 1602.**

**Like most inventions, these capital market developments arose out of necessity and self-interest.** The voyages across the world in search of new trade routes were risky ventures, so it made sense for merchants to sell some of the risk associated with the voyage to others in exchange for a share of the future profits. At the time the Dutch introduced equity shares in their voyages in the mid-1500s, it was revolutionary. Until 1600, these shares were held by only a small number of merchants, largely lacked transparency, and were illiquid, so their attractiveness to outside investors was limited.

**The formation of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in August 1602 and the listing of the Dutch East India Company spread share ownership much wider** (more than one in 50 Dutch adults owned shares), and the exchange’s clear rules about ownership and transfer of shares made the market much more transparent. **The Dutch East India Company was an equally revolutionary invention. The world’s first transnational corporation, it had many of the features you see in companies today**—shareholders, a corporate logo, a board of directors, etc. Capital markets enabled investors to save, merchants to raise funds, and everyone to have a liquid market in which transfers of capital could happen easily and efficiently, fueling a new era of wealth accumulation. At their peak in the early 1700s, Dutch East India Company dividends accounted for nearly $1 out of every $100 of total Dutch GDP.

Importantly, the Dutch outcompeted the Spanish and the Portuguese, which led them to win the main prize—a higher share of the trading between Europe and Asia, particularly China and Indonesia, which was very profitable.

**In addition to creating an equity market, the Dutch developed an innovative banking system, which grew rapidly and began to finance international trade for Dutch and non-Dutch merchants.** Prior to the Dutch banking innovations, the international currency situation was a mess. In the late 1500s, around 800 different foreign and domestic coins circulated in the Netherlands, many of which were debased (i.e., had a lowered content of precious metal in the coins) and difficult to distinguish from counterfeits. This created uncertainty over the value of money, which made international trade slower and more expensive.

In 1609, the Bank of Amsterdam was established as an exchange bank to protect commercial creditors from unreliable commodity money in general circulation. The Bank of Amsterdam undertook activities that would generate monetary stability and put the Netherlands’ coinage, the bank’s letters of credit, and the Dutch financial system at the center of global finance. Notably, this bank guilder, though backed by hard currency, was essentially Type 2 money. That set up the guilder as a true reserve currency, the first of its kind.

As a result of this system, the guilder remained effective as both a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth. **Bank of Amsterdam bills of exchange improved their status as a reserve currency. Baltic and Russian trade relied solely on guilders and Bank of Amsterdam bills of exchange for pricing and contract settlement.**5

#### The New World Order: The Thirty Years’ War and the Peace of Westphalia
Then came the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48). While the Dutch played a relatively minor role in the Europe-wide conflict, it is worth covering this war in some detail given its importance to the internal and external orders of Europe more broadly. It is also a classic case of how internal and external orders work together.

All the classic balance of power dynamics came into play. In this case, the Thirty Years’ War was a classic fight over wealth and power, just a lot longer one. On one side was the Catholic emperor of Habsburg Austria, who was allied with the German Catholic territories (most prominently Bavaria), as well as with Spain and the Papal States. On the other side were the German Protestant nobles, allied at different points in time with Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, and France. The fighting was about money, religion (Protestants versus Catholics), and geopolitics. The alliances were pretty complex. For example, the French monarchy—despite being Catholic and having Cardinal Richelieu6 driving policy—was allied (first secretly, then openly) with both Lutheran Sweden and largely Calvinist Netherlands. That is because money and geopolitics mattered more than religious ideologies.

**The Habsburgs lost the war. That left them in a meaningfully weakened position.** The treaty that established the new international order, the Peace of Westphalia, expanded the autonomy of the individual princes of the Holy Roman Empire, further eroding the limited authority of the Austrian emperor over the other states. More importantly, **the deal that was cut at Westphalia invented countries as we know them, which is to say it allowed sovereignty of the state with the ability to make choices within its geographic borders** (e.g., their religions, their languages, and all their rules) and instituted respect for those boundaries so that no longer would borderless, free-flowing power grabs occur (without, of course, the understanding that you’d be starting a major war). The emergence of the concept of states led to nationalism and the pursuit of national interests, which reshaped the concept of the balance of power between rival states. **It also made the religious authorities much less powerful.**

**The Peace of Westphalia reflected what I call the “exhaustion of war,” which contributed to a long period of peace and prosperity that followed.** Like all big wars, the Thirty Years’ War produced devastating losses of life, property, and wealth. One quarter of the population of Europe died from combat, disease, or starvation. **Because wars are so much more terrible than even those who are eager for them can imagine, they lead to treaties that redefine the order and are followed by periods of peace, until the next big war happens.**

**The Dutch benefited greatly from the new balance of power and period of relative stability**; probably most importantly, it protected them from the threat of Habsburg domination.

It is also the case that  wars are devastating financially; that is true for the winners and much more so for the losers.* For example, France, though a “winner” and only indirectly involved for much of the war, experienced such bad financial problems and instability as a result that it was faced with widespread rebellions. The losing Habsburg Empire was even more devastated. Relative to the French and Spanish, the Dutch were less financially hurt. They benefited from the peace that fostered the Dutch Golden Age. The Dutch also benefited from the military developments that occurred in the war because, when coupled with the shipping capabilities of the Dutch East India Company, this strong shipping and military combination expanded Dutch power around the world.

### THE TOP
**The Dutch Golden Age led the Dutch to shift their attentions to “living the good life” in a way that weakened their finances. Other powers rose too and began to challenge them. The arrival of capitalism, combined with the new approaches of the Enlightenment, led to an economic transformation called the Industrial Revolution, which was centered in Britain.** The Dutch, who had been the unparalleled leaders in innovation, trade, and wealth in the 1600s, failed to keep up. Eventually the cost of maintaining a declining and overextended empire became unsustainable.

This chart shows a number of key steps.

*
At the top, the Dutch saw a reversal of many of the classic ingredients we discussed earlier:

The Dutch **educational and technological edge eroded**.
The Dutch became **uncompetitive** in general and via the decline of the Dutch East India Company.
**In the 1700s, the Industrial Revolution led the British to overtake the Dutch as the preeminent economic and financial power in Europe.**
Slower economic growth relative to other powers made it more difficult to pay for and maintain its vast empire (especially one controlled by such a small nation). Increasing military conflicts (in attempts to protect their vast wealth around the world) left the Dutch **overextended and overindebted**.
This all set the stage for the **decline in the guilder’s reserve** **currency status**, which ultimately deteriorated after the Dutch **lost a war** (and with it, important assets) to the British.
With the Dutch Empire weakened, its **financial center eroded**, especially after a series of debt crises and a run on the central bank and currency.

Even though the Peace of Westphalia brought relative peace and stability to Europe, the Dutch were still engaged in a number of conflicts throughout their time as an empire, as opponents saw their weaknesses and attacked, especially via naval wars fought over trade. Here is a brief summary of the wars the Dutch fought to build and then to hold on to its empire:

**Eighty Years’ War (1566–1648)**: This was the revolt by Protestant Netherlands against Catholic Spain. The Dutch first declared independence in 1581, but their full independence was not realized until the Peace of Westphalia (1648) ended both the Thirty Years’ War and the Eighty Years’ War.
**The First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–54)**: This was a trade war that began when the English Parliament passed the Navigation Act of 1651, mandating that all goods from its American colonies be carried by English ships. The war was largely a stalemate and failed to resolve the trade rivalry between the nations.
**The Dano-Swedish War (1657–60)**: This began when Sweden declared war on Denmark, a Dutch ally, threatening the highly profitable Baltic trade routes. The Dutch defeated the Swedish.
**The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665–67)**: England and the Netherlands fought over another trade dispute, which ended with a Dutch victory.
**The Franco-Dutch War (1672–78) and the Third Anglo-Dutch War (1672–74)**: These were also fights over trade. The Dutch foiled French plans to conquer the Netherlands and forced them to reduce some of their tariffs, but at a tremendous cost.
**The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (1780–84)**: The British began the war in retaliation for Dutch support of the colonies in the American Revolution. It ended in a significant defeat for the Dutch, ushering in the end of the guilder as a reserve currency.

Ironically, it was a military victory, one that began nearly a century of peace, that led power to shift away from the Netherlands. In 1688, William III of Orange married Mary II, who was the daughter of the unpopular king of England, and successfully invaded England and took power. This was known as the Glorious Revolution and created a new internal order for Great Britain. While it was undoubtedly good for the Dutch in the short run to have William III on the British throne, **the second-order consequences of economic integration and military cooperation played a major role in the decline of Dutch economic power and the guilder over the next century**.

After 1688, as Great Britain became more competitive, Dutch merchants shifted their operations to London, hastening its rise as an international center of finance. The alliance also gave English merchants access to Dutch trade. William III moved to England instead of focusing his attention on ruling the Netherlands. When he died heirless in 1702, the direct connection between the two nations was broken, and the various Dutch provinces that had been unified under him began to splinter. While England and the Netherlands continued to have military partnerships against the French during most of the 80-plus years leading up to the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, by the mid-1700s they were beginning to bump into each other in many of the same markets.

By the mid-18th century, the Dutch Empire was no longer the world’s leading empire. Britain especially had learned from Dutch innovations and made their own investments in education to strengthen their people’s capabilities. These abilities, coupled with the use of capitalism, led to the advancements that made up the Industrial Revolution, which brought about constant improvements on existing concepts to make production more efficient, such as standardizing inputs and moving production from individual artisans to factories. It also led to transformative new inventions. This allowed the British to become more productive, capture more trade, and build military might.

Additionally, and as is classic, **as the Dutch became extremely wealthy, they became less competitive**—for example, their wages were generally higher than those in other parts of Europe. The Dutch East India Company lost its competitive edge as well. For example, it was ineffective in trading popular new products like tea. **Dutch economic growth slowed relative to other powers, which made it more difficult for the Dutch to pay for and maintain their vast empire.** Increasing military conflicts to protect their vast wealth left them **overextended**.

Thus, from around 1725 through around 1800 the financial decline unfolded in the classic ways. These charts do a good job of conveying both the ascent and the decline of the Bank of Amsterdam.

As is classic, the reserve currency status of the guilder remained strong even as the Netherlands’ other powers began to decline. Because bills of exchange were the dominant vehicle for international trade credit, all merchants wishing to trade with the Dutch were forced to open an account at the Bank of Amsterdam, which led to **around 40 percent of global trade being settled in Amsterdam using bank guilders**. The importance of the Dutch in trade and financial transactions, the Bank of Amsterdam’s policies that made the guilder very effective as both a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth, and the fact that Dutch commercial entities and banks insisted on its usage all cemented the guilder’s place as the first global reserve currency.7 This gave the Dutch the “extraordinary privilege” of being able to get into a lot of debt.

### THE DECLINE
**Around 1750 the British (and the French) became stronger than the Dutch, both because their own power had grown and because the Dutch had become weaker. As is classic, the Dutch a) became more indebted, b) experienced a lot of internal fighting over wealth,**8 **and c) weakened militarily. All this made them vulnerable to decline and attack.**

As earnings from abroad fell, wealthy Dutch savers moved their cash into British investments, which were more attractive due to their strong growth and higher yields.9 Despite this, the guilder remained widely used as a global reserve currency. As explained earlier, reserve currency status classically lags the decline of other key drivers of the rise and fall of empires. Then, **as is typical, a rising great power challenged the existing great power in a war**.

Starting in the 1770s, the English began to interfere with Dutch shipping, escalating the conflict after the Dutch traded arms with the colonies during the American Revolution. In retaliation, the English delivered a massive blow to the Dutch Navy in the Caribbean in 1781, taking over Dutch territories there and in the East Indies as well. Having lost half its ships and access to its key trade routes, the Dutch East India Company had to borrow heavily from the Bank of Amsterdam to stay alive. Rival powers took the Dutch defeat as an opportunity to grab still more of the Dutch shipping business. British blockades in the Netherlands and in the East Indies caused a liquidity crisis. The financial consequences of these events can be seen in the following charts.

**Financial losses and large debts led to the classic move by the central bank to print more money. As the Bank of Amsterdam printed more and more paper money to provide loans to the Dutch** **East India Company, it soon became clear that there would not be enough gold and silver to cover all the paper claims on it. That led to the classic “run on the bank” dynamic, in which investors exchanged their paper money for precious metals.** With the bank’s store of precious metals exhausted, the supply of guilders soared, even as demand for them fell, as shown in the following chart.

The next chart shows this explosion of loans on the bank’s balance sheet throughout the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. (For reference, the full balance sheet at the start of the war was about 20 million bank guilders outstanding, so this represented a roughly 50 percent expansion in the Bank of Amsterdam’s balance sheet.) The Bank of Amsterdam had no choice; the Dutch East India Company was too big to fail because the government depended on loans from the company.

**Interest rates rose and the Bank of Amsterdam had to devalue, undermining the credibility of the guilder as a storehold of wealth.**11 As a result, the British pound replaced the Dutch guilder as the leading reserve currency.

What happened to the Dutch was classic, as described in Chapter 1’s summary of why empires rise and fall and Chapter 3’s description of how money, credit, and debt work. **The Bank of Amsterdam started with a Type 1 monetary system (precious metal) that morphed into a Type 2 monetary system (paper money linked to precious metal).** As usual, this transition occurred at a time of financial stress and military conflict. It was risky because the transition decreased trust in the currency and added to the risk of a bank-run-like dynamic, which is exactly what occurred. Bank of Amsterdam deposits (i.e., holdings of short-term debt) had been a reliable storehold of wealth for nearly two centuries. They began to trade at large discounts to guilder coins (which were made of gold and silver). The bank used its holdings of coin and precious metals (i.e., its reserves) to buy its currency on the open market to support the value of deposits, but it lacked adequate foreign currency reserves to do this indefinitely. Accounts backed by coins held at the bank plummeted from 17 million guilder in March 1780 to only 300,000 guilder in January 1783 as owners of these gold and silver coins demanded them back. The bank run marked the end of the Dutch Empire and the guilder as a reserve currency. In 1791 the bank was taken over by the City of Amsterdam, and in 1795 the French revolutionary government overthrew the Dutch Republic, establishing a client state in its place. After being nationalized in 1796, rendering its stock worthless, the Dutch East India Company’s charter expired in 1799.

The following charts show the exchange rates between the guilder and the pound and gold. As it became clear that the bank no longer had any credibility, investors fled to other assets and currencies.12

The next chart shows the returns of holding Dutch East India Company stock starting in various years. As with most bubble companies, it did great at first and seemed to have great fundamentals. This attracted still more investors even after those fundamentals began to weaken. Ultimately its failed fundamentals and excessive debt burdens broke it.

As is typical, the returns of investment assets in the declining empire fall relative to the returns of investing in the rising empire. Returns on investment in the British East India Company, for example, far exceeded those in the Dutch East India Company, and the returns on Dutch government bonds were terrible relative to British government bonds.

The decline of the Dutch Empire led to the next Big Cycle in world history: the rise and decline of the British Empire and its reserve currency. That story—which is basically the same story, just a century or so later in a more technologically evolved form with people in different clothes speaking a different language—is told in the next chapter.

1 By 1500, the territory of modern-day Spain was increasingly unified following more than 500 years of conflict between Christian kingdoms and Muslim powers that had ruled most of the area since the 700s. The two largest kingdoms, Castile and Aragon, were joined together following the marriage of their rulers in 1469, and in 1492 they conquered Spain’s last Muslim kingdom in Granada. The emergent Spanish power had a strong military and very close ties to the Catholic Church—significant portions of the Reconquista of Muslim Spain took the form of papally supported crusades, and religious and monarchic authorities were often closely aligned, as in the Spanish Inquisition.

2 For example, the Wars of Religion in France led to millions of deaths from 1550 to 1600, while England violently switched faiths at several points in the 1500s as new monarchs came to the throne. Even later on, the devastating English Civil Wars of the mid-1600s were significantly driven by religious strife.

3 Rough estimate based on my calculations.

4 In this chapter, when talking about the “guilder,” we are generally referring to guilder bank notes, which were used at the Bank of Amsterdam, rather than to the physical coin (also called “guilder”), which was made of a precious metal (i.e., Type 1 money).

5 By 1650, it was fairly common for, say, a merchant in London to pay for goods imported from Moscow with a bill drawn on their deposit in Amsterdam. Both the number of accounts and deposit base of the bank rose continually through 1650.

6 Cardinal Richelieu was the most important leader in France at the time, serving as chief minister from 1624 until 1642. Richelieu was a brilliant man who provided advice to the two rivals for control of the monarchy in France: the queen mother and her young son Louis XIII. (You can’t make this stuff up.) Richelieu had his own particular view of how an internal order should work, which was that the state should be all-powerful—more important than what the monarchy, church, or nobility wanted. Besides being a great big-picture thinker, he was a great administrator who made the system work well. He improved efficiency throughout the kingdom, effectively collecting taxes and controlling power over the nobility and local authorities. He created the notions of national interest and balance of power—e.g., focusing policy on the goal of having France balance the Habsburg hegemony. This wasn’t that long after Machiavelli’s theories first circulated. His concept of keeping Central Europe divided and balanced (because united it would dominate other areas) worked from 1624 until the French Revolution (for more, see Henry Kissinger’s World Order*).

7 Available payment data supports the claim that the guilder accounted for a large share of global trade: the annual value of payments made through the bank peaked in the 1760s at about 1.5 times the Dutch Republic’s annual GDP (with some estimates more than double that). Similar ratios for the United Kingdom in 1868 and the United States in 1955 were 3.6 and 2.7, respectively.

8 A good example of this is the popularity of the Patriot Movement in the Netherlands around this time.

9 There was a general rise in foreign investment by the Dutch during this period. Examples include Dutch purchases of stock in the British East India Company and the City of London selling term annuities (bonds) to Dutch investors. For a further description, see Hart, Jonker, and van Zanden, *A Financial History of the Netherlands*.

10 This chart only shows the financial results from the Dutch East India Company reported *in patria*, i.e., the Netherlands. It does not include the parts of the revenue and debt from its operations in Asia but does include its revenue from goods it sourced in Asia and sold in Europe.

11 The Bank of Amsterdam was ahead of its time and used ledgers instead of real “paper money.” See Quinn & Roberds, “The Bank of Amsterdam Through the Lens of Monetary Competition.”

12 Historical data suggests that by 1795 bank deposits were trading at a -25 percent discount to actual coin. See Quinn & Roberds, “Death of a Reserve Currency.”

13 To fully represent the likely economics of a deposit holder at the Bank of Amsterdam, we assumed depositors each received their pro-rated share of precious metal still in the bank’s vaults when it closed (that was roughly 20 percent of the fully backed amount, thus the approximately 80 percent total devaluation).
